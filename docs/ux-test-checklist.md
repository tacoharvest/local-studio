# vLLM Studio — Full UX Test Checklist

_Living checklist for the chat-session QA loop. Tested against the rebuilt Electron app (QA profile, CDP 9333) on the live `glm-5.2` backend. Status: ⬜ untested · ✅ pass · ❌ fail (issue) · 🔧 fixed · ⏭️ blocked._

Legend for "layer": which subsystem the flow exercises (Parse = content pipeline, Trans = transport/SSE, Sess = session lifecycle, UI = rendering).

---

## A. Session lifecycle

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Layer | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| A1 | New chat | Click "New chat" | Empty composer, fresh session id, title "New session" | Sess | ⬜ |
| A2 | First message creates session | Type + send | User bubble + assistant bubble appear; title derives from prompt | Sess | ⬜ |
| A3 | Switch chat A→B | Click another session in sidebar | B's transcript loads, A's preserved, no bleed | Sess | ⬜ |
| A4 | Switch back B→A | Click A again | A's full transcript intact (incl. tables/reasoning) | Sess/Parse | ⬜ |
| A5 | Switch to a still-streaming chat | Start turn in A, switch to B, switch back to A | A still streaming or settled correctly, no dup/loss | Trans/Parse | ⬜ |
| A6 | Rename session | Session options → rename | Title updates in sidebar + tab | Sess | ⬜ |
| A7 | Pin / unpin session | Toggle pin | Stays pinned across reloads | Sess | ⬜ |
| A8 | Delete session | Delete | Removed from sidebar; active switches to another | Sess | ⬜ |
| A9 | Reopen after delete-all | Delete all, new chat | Clean empty starter state | Sess | ⬜ |

## B. Messaging & streaming

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Layer | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| B1 | Send single message | Type + Send | Streams token-by-token, settles to idle | Trans/Parse | ⬜ |
| B2 | **Reasoning visible while streaming** | Send a reasoning prompt | "Thinking" expands and shows reasoning text LIVE, collapses to "Thought · Worked for Xs" when done | UI/Parse | 🔧 (fix applied, retest) |

| B5 | Send 2 messages in a row | Send, wait, send again | Two turns, correct order, second targets a new bubble | Sess/Parse | ⬜ |
| B6 | Steer mid-stream (follow-up) | Send, then send again WHILE streaming | Second message queues/steers; tokens land in the right bubble | Sess/Parse | ⬜ |
| B7 | Stop generation | Click Stop mid-stream | Stream halts, status idle, partial content kept | Trans/Sess | ⬜ |
| B8 | Long multi-paragraph answer | Ask for long prose | Paragraph/blank-line boundaries preserved | Parse | ⬜ |
| B9 | Tool-using turn | Prompt that triggers a tool | Activity group shows tool call + result; collapses after | Parse/UI | ⬜ |
| B10 | Reasoning + tool interleave | Reasoning then tool then text | Reasoning under activity, answer as content, order correct | Parse | ⬜ |
| B11 | Empty / whitespace answer | Edge prompt | No phantom blank bubble | Parse | ⬜ |

## C. Transport / reload / reconnect

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Layer | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| C1 | Reload after a settled turn | Finish a turn, reload | Full transcript rehydrates (tables/reasoning intact) | Trans/Parse | ⬜ |
| C2 | **Reload mid-stream (reattach)** | Reload WHILE streaming | Turn reattaches and continues/settles; no empty session | Trans/Parse | ❌ (empty session — standalone SSE buffering, Phase 3b) |
| C3 | Backend blip | Kill/restart controller mid-turn | Session reconnects or idles with visible error, no infinite spin | Trans | ⬜ |
| C4 | `/events` system stream | Watch Status page over time | GPU/log stream keeps flowing, no `Controller already closed` | Trans | ❌ (proxy double-close error) |
| C5 | Navigate away & back during stream | Status → back to chat mid-stream | Stream still live or settled, cursor correct | Trans/Sess | ⬜ |

## Issues found (running log)

1. **B2 reasoning hidden while streaming** — outer `ActivityDisclosure` (`session-pane-block-router.tsx`) defaulted collapsed (`expanded=false`), hiding the inner reasoning that already auto-opens while active. **Fix applied:** `expanded = userExpanded ?? live` so it auto-expands while streaming and collapses when settled. _Retest after rebuild._
2. **C2 reload mid-stream → empty session** — standalone embedded server buffers the locally-built `/api/agent/runtime/events` SSE; reattach gets nothing. **Phase 3b** (snapshot+cursor JSON-GET resume).
3. **C4 `/events` proxy `Controller is already closed`** — `/api/proxy/[...path]` stream controller closed twice. **🔧 Fixed** (idempotent `safeClose` + `finished` flag; client disconnect is now a no-op, not a logged error). Uncommitted in working tree (file also carries the pre-existing `settings-service` import refactor — commit together).

## Iteration log

### Iteration 1 (live, rebuilt Electron, glm-5.2)
**Verified pass:** A1 New chat (fresh empty session) · B2 **Reasoning visible while streaming** 🔧✅ (committed `86c0c089`; "Thinking" block auto-expands and streams full internal reasoning live, collapses to "Worked for Xs" on settle) · B3 Table renders live ✅ · sessions list in sidebar (under collapsed "Chats" section) · 7-day history persists.
**Fixed this iteration:** B2 reasoning-while-streaming (committed) · C4 proxy double-close (working tree).
**Notes / minor:** the sidebar "Chats" section defaults **collapsed** — recent chats are hidden until you expand it (possible UX nit: surface recent chats by default). Test-harness: re-snapshot before each click (refs go stale after navigation).
**Environment caveat:** the isolated QA profile (`~/Library/Application Support/vLLM Studio QA`) was seeded with backend config but **not `chats.db`**, so reload/persistence flows (C1, C2) can't be tested faithfully yet — next iteration seeds `chats.db` (additive copy) for a true environment.

**Next iteration queue:** faithful env (seed chats.db) → A3/A4 switch chats + load-old-session table render (replay path) → B5 send-2-in-a-row → B6 steer mid-stream → B7 stop → C1 reload-settled → C2/Phase 3b reload-mid-stream reattach (standalone SSE transport) → D/E/F navigation, model picker, panels.

### Iteration 2 (sidebar bugs — user-reported)
User report: switching sessions struggles · no blue-circle notifications · leave/rejoin unreliable · follow-up prompts bug out.
**Fixed + verified:**
- **B5 follow-up after settle 🔧✅** (committed `a75768b1`): a 2nd message used to stall (added but no turn started). Root cause — `runtimeAcceptsControl` (chat-pane) routed it as a *steer* because the runtime still reports `active=true` after a turn settles (SDK session stays loaded), steering an idle agent → dropped. Fix: gate steer on the LOCAL turn being in-flight (`tab.status` running/starting). Verified live: msg1→settle→msg2 now answers.
**Foundation committed (needs more):**
- **Blue-circle unseen dot** (committed `aca5b07f`): `unseen` flag on active-session snapshot + sidebar dot. Correct, but doesn't fire in the common single-pane flow (see root cause below).
**Root cause of the remaining sidebar bugs (verified live):** navigating to another chat **replaces the single pane and drops the previous running session from the active set** — it shows **no spinner, no dot, and isn't listed** while it keeps running server-side. This is the through-line for "no notifications," "switching struggles," and "leave/rejoin unreliable." A background turn becomes invisible and must reattach on return (which is also broken in standalone — Phase 3b).
**Next (core fix):** surface running / just-finished sessions on sidebar rows from the runtime-list poll (`listRuntimeSessions`) — a session running server-side gets a spinner, a just-finished one gets the unseen dot — independent of whether it's open in a pane. Then verify switch-away → indicator → switch-back → content (with faithful env + Phase 3b reattach).

### Iteration 3 (user-reported: reorder + navbar)
User report: "opened chat, switched session, got lost — the sessions reordered and I lost the original. Do not reorder based on what's open. Opening a sidechat via navbar is awful, it breaks."
**Fixed + verified:**
- **Sidebar reorder-on-open 🔧✅** (committed `5acf5871`): opening a session promoted it to the top because open sessions rendered in a separate block ABOVE history. Now ONE list ordered by stable start time; an open session keeps its position (anchored to its original history start time so opening never changes its sort key). Verified live: a session at position 7 stayed at the bottom (pos 8) when opened instead of jumping to #1; no duplicate rows (two same-looking codex rows confirmed to be distinct session ids).
**Still to do (needs reproduction):**
- **"Opening a sidechat via navbar breaks"** — maps to the split-pane / `OpenSession`/`splitTab` path (`pane-controller.ts:226-421`). Vague; reproduce live (open a session into a split/side pane via the top navbar) and characterize the break before fixing.

### Iteration 4 (user-reported: abort error + module-not-found)
User report: "request aborted shouldn't be an error — it's throwing an error which is wrong" + agent error `Cannot find module …/pi-ai/dist/providers/openai-completions.js`.
**Fixed + verified live (committed `df6af425`):**
- **B7 abort ≠ error 🔧✅** — a turn ending `stopReason:"aborted"` (Stop pressed / navigated away) was treated as a failure: tools→error, "Assistant turn aborted." event block, `session.error` set. Now settles cleanly (tools→done, no error block, no session error, partial content kept). Only `stopReason:"error"` is a failure. Regression test added (63 green). **Verified live:** pressed Stop mid-turn → clean settle, no error block, composer ready (screenshot).
- **Standalone module-not-found 🔧✅** — `pi-ai/register-builtins.js` pulls providers in dynamically; Next's tracer omitted `openai-completions.js` intermittently → agent threw at runtime. Added `outputFileTracingIncludes` for the whole `pi-ai/dist` (top-level + nested under pi-coding-agent). **Verified:** `openai-completions.js` + full 18-provider set present in `.next/standalone` after build.
**Note:** the user's in-app prompt ("go to ~/.codex/config.toml and remove the pi ai gateway; identify codex-app computer-use/plugin issues") is a task for the *agent* to run once it works — not a code change here. Once these land, that prompt should execute instead of erroring.

### Iteration 5 (navbar "sidechat breaks" — root-caused)
**Confirmed root cause (code-traced):** the **Side chat** (right-panel secondary `ChatPane`, `paneId="computer-side-chat"`, launched from the computer-panel "Side chat" card → `onOpenSideChat`) holds its session in **local `useState`** in `agent-browser-panel.tsx` (`sideChatSession`), never dispatched to the workspace store. The runtime controller is a singleton bound in `use-workspace.ts` with `getSessions: () => sessionsRef.current` and driven by `reconcile(sessionsRef.current)` — **workspace sessions only**. So the side-chat's `runtimeSessionId` is never reconciled → no SSE attachment → its turns POST `/turn` but never stream back → it "breaks" (message sent, no response). Not a render crash (`createSideChatSession` builds a valid session via `makeFreshTab`).
**Fix (NOT yet done — architectural, ~medium):** make the controller reconcile the active side-chat session alongside workspace sessions (e.g. lift it into a shared ref/the workspace set, or have the side-chat engine register its session for subscription). Needs the faithful env + the exact user repro to verify the streaming end-to-end. **Deferred pending user steer** — it's a real but non-trivial change and risky to land blind.

### Iteration 6 (Background notifications — user chose this)
**Done (committed `bce0d11b` + `a2329010`; live verify pending build):** the runtime controller now exposes the poll's **active-session-id set** (`subscribeActiveRuntimeIds`/`getActiveRuntimeIds`) plus an **unseen-finished set** (`getUnseenFinishedIds`/`markRuntimeSeen`) via a tiny `useSyncExternalStore`-stable store — no redundant poll, no change to the core streaming/commit path. The sidebar's **history rows** now show: a **working spinner** while a session runs in the background (independent of pane membership), and an **accent "unseen" dot** when a background turn just finished (cleared when the session re-runs or you open it). Directly addresses "you don't get notifications (blue circle)" + "switching away makes it invisible." 94 tests green.
**Live verify (partial):** the working spinner DID render on a sidebar row for a background turn; clean active-vs-background confirmation was blocked by agent-browser ref instability (kept landing on the wrong session). Code is traced-correct + unit-tested. **Manual check recommended:** start a turn in one chat, switch to a clearly different chat, look for the spinner on the first chat's sidebar row.
**Gap found (real):** a brand-NEW backgrounded session **vanishes from the sidebar** — it's not in the server history list yet and it left the workspace active set, so there's no row to indicate on. The spinner/dot only attach to sessions that already have a row (e.g. re-running an old chat). The common "new chat → run → switch away" case still goes invisible. **Full fix = the session-lifecycle change** (keep a backgrounded-but-running session visible, e.g. a "recently backgrounded" set or refetch history on runtime change) — bigger, deferred.

### Iteration 7 (newlines collapsing — user-reported)
User: "we are missing new lines i saw it make a list but all without newlines."
**Fixed (committed `fd118a6c`; needs controller deploy to go live):** the **controller**'s `normalizeTextDelta` cumulative-snapshot check used `text.length >= previous.text.length && startsWith` — a delta that EQUALS the accumulated text (a second `"\n"` after a first `"\n"`, i.e. a model opening with a blank line before a list) was misread as a cumulative snapshot, dropped, AND flipped the stream into snapshot mode, mangling the rest → list on one line. Fix: strict `>` for cumulative + `text.trim() !== ""` guard on the replay-suppress. Model-dependent (glm-5.2 didn't show it; others do). +2 regression tests; 51/51 controller tests green. **The frontend was already lossless here** (appendDelta verbatim + snapshot path); this was the last of the 3 "guessing" layers from the audit. **DEPLOY: `scripts/deploy-remote.sh controller` (restarts the model).**

### Iteration 8 (stray `</arg_value>` in reasoning — user screenshot)
User screenshot: a "Thought" reasoning bubble showing a lone `</arg_value>` — a tool-call XML fragment leaking.
**Fixed (committed `a798ebd0`; needs controller deploy):** `stripToolCallsFromContent` (controller/tool-call-parser.ts) only removed COMPLETE `<tool_call>…</tool_call>` blocks, so a tool call in the `<parameter>/<arg_value>` dialect or split across stream deltas left a stray fragment that leaked into the answer/reasoning. Added two passes: drop a dangling `<tool_call>` (open-to-end) + strip orphan tool-call structural tags (tool_call/arguments/arg_value/arg_key/invoke/function/parameter). +1 regression test (lone tag, partial call, prose untouched). 52/52 controller tests green.

### Iteration 9 (nav/UI sweep — no bugs)
**Verified pass, no issues:** D2 nav (Status/Usage/Models/Plugins/Server all load; the Server "error" is just the controller LOGS showing a backend vLLM/triton launch error — not a UI crash) · D1 sidebar collapse/expand · D5 Search ⌘K (opens correctly). Note: controller/model went **OFFLINE** mid-session (`rtx-6000-pod OFFLINE`), so agent-chat flows (B*, tool turns) can't be re-tested until a model is relaunched (`POST /launch/:recipeId`).

### Iteration 10 (UI panels sweep — no bugs)
**Verified pass, no crashes:** F2 Filesystem panel (lists files), F5 Canvas panel (renders), Browser panel (no crash; URL-bar internals inconclusive via automation). Git-diff (Review) + Terminal not reached (in the launcher card view; harness ref instability). No React error boundaries anywhere.
**Assessment:** the autonomous UI/nav sweep is thorough and clean — no contained bugs remain that I can find without the model online. High-value chat-flow testing (steer mid-stream, tool turns, reload-mid-stream) is blocked until a model is relaunched. The substantive remaining work is the deferred architectural items (side-chat streaming, Phase 3b transport, new-session sidebar visibility) which need a faithful env / user steer.

## ⚠️ Pending controller deploys (2 fixes)
Both `fd118a6c` (newline collapse) and `a798ebd0` (tool-call fragment leak) are **controller** changes — they only reach the live app after `scripts/deploy-remote.sh controller` (which restarts the running model). Not auto-deployed (outward-facing + kills the model).

### Iteration 11 (new-session-visibility — full root cause + ready fix spec)
**Root cause (fully traced):** switching away from a single-pane running session **destroys its tab**. Chain: `setPaneSession`→`pruneOrphanSessions` (pane-controller.ts:63) → `pruneSessions` (runtime/store.ts:23) deletes every session id not in `referencedSessionIds` (selectors.ts — **pane sessions only**). And `computeActiveSessionBroadcast` (workspace/effects.ts:199) only iterates `panesById`. So a backgrounded running session is pruned + never broadcast → vanishes everywhere.
**Ready fix spec (2 contained, unit-testable changes — NOT landed: needs model online to verify lifecycle interactions):**
1. `pruneSessions`: keep a session whose `status` is `running`/`starting` even if unreferenced (`if (!referencedIds.has(id) && !isRunning(session))`). Bounded: once it settles to idle/done, the next prune removes it (reverts to current behavior).
2. `computeActiveSessionBroadcast`: after the pane loop, also push running sessions from `state.sessions` not already included, with `paneId:""`, `focused:false`.
**Handoff:** running+open → active row; running+backgrounded → orphan active row (spinner, via this fix); finished+backgrounded → pruned → history row (unseen dot, via the iteration-6 poll feature already shipped). **Risks to verify live:** does closing a running tab now leak it? prune timing after finish vs history persistence; merge/focus interaction with `paneId:""` orphans. **Defer until model online** — exactly the Phase-4 session-identity area the audit flagged as riskiest.

## Remaining big items (need user steer / faithful env)
1. **Side-chat streaming** — integrate side-chat session into runtime reconcile (CORE controller change; high risk, deferred).
2. **Phase 3b transport** — cursor+snapshot JSON-GET resume so reload-mid-stream reattaches in the standalone build (CORE transport; high risk).

### Iteration 12 (model BACK ONLINE `glm-5.2` — landed + live-verified the iter-11 fix, swept reported flows)
Model `glm-5.2` is serving again, so the iteration-11 fix was implemented and verified end-to-end (QA Electron rebuild, CDP 9333).
- 🔧✅ **New-session-visibility** (commit `312a411b`): both contained changes landed (`pruneSessions` keeps running/starting orphans; `computeActiveSessionBroadcast` pushes them as `paneId:""` background entries). +prune/broadcast unit tests; 177/177 e2e green. **Live:** start a turn → switch to New chat → the backgrounded session shows a **running spinner** in the expanded sidebar. No tab leak observed on close; settled orphan pruned on next pass.
- 🔧✅ **Collapsed-Chats "blue circle"** (commit `6e6fac5f`): accent dot on the collapsed **Chats** header when a background chat has unseen activity (`unseen` flag, so the chat you're watching never trips it). **Live:** focused on running chat → no dot; navigate away mid-stream → "Chats •" appears (screenshot). This is the user's "no blue-circle notification" fix.
- ✅ **Reasoning visible while streaming** (`86c0c089`): glm-5.2 streams a "Thought" block (auto-expanded), collapses to "Thought / Worked for Ns" on settle; markdown answer renders clean (lists/bold/structure). LaTeX `$$…$$` renders raw (no KaTeX — enhancement, unreported).
- ✅ **B-series: two messages in a row** (`a75768b1`): send → settle (FIRST-OK) → follow-up runs and settles (SECOND-OK). No stall.
- ✅ **Switch chats keeps your place** (`5acf5871`): opening the chat at sidebar position 5 kept it at position 5; 22 chats, order fully preserved, no dupes/loss.
- ✅ **Abort-not-error** (`df6af425`): Stop mid-stream settles clean — no error text, no error-styled block, partial content kept.
- ❌ **Side-chat via navbar** (open right panel → "Show tools" + → "Side chat" → send): **LIVE-REPRODUCED — spins at running 20s+, NEVER replies, no error.** Root cause confirmed: side-chat session in local `useState`, never in the workspace store, so the single-binding `sessionRuntimeController` never subscribes (it explicitly forbids other subscribers). **DEFERRED — core/high-risk to the critical streaming path + a product decision ("is a side chat a first-class session?"); needs user sign-off.** Two fix options documented in memory `project-chat-session-pipeline-audit`.
- ⚠️ **Note (unreported):** composer set to a non-loaded model (e.g. `nemotron-3-ultra`, `active:false`) → raw `503 status code (no body)`. A "model not running" message would be friendlier.

### Iteration 21 (BUG: chat "shaking/pausing/clipping" during streaming — root-caused + fixed)
User report (with screenshots): "the chat is shaking pausing and starting and rerendering… why clip". Diagnosed live (read-only instrumentation, then a patched-`scrollTop`-setter repro):
- **At rest: fully stable** (no jitter, no rAF loop, scroll poll `/api/agent/runtime/sessions` is a normal 5 s poll — false lead). The shake is **streaming-only**.
- **Root cause (`68f6ce2d`)**: the activity/"Thought" disclosure collapsed **mid-stream** — its `live` flag flips false the instant the answer becomes the trailing block, so the disclosure closes while still on-screen, shrinking content ~287 px. The scroller runs **`overflow-anchor: none`** (manual bottom-pin), so the browser **clamps the viewport upward** = the visible jump. Patched `scrollTop` setter proved **0 JS upward-scrolls** → it was a browser clamp from the height shrink, not a scroll call. **Fix**: added `turnLive` (whole-turn-streaming) to drive `expanded`, keeping `live` only for the "Working" shimmer; the group now holds expansion until the turn fully settles (reasoning has scrolled off-screen by then → collapse invisible). **Verified on rebuilt QA app: 0 mid-stream upward jumps (was up to 153 px); the content-shrink now fires only at `streaming:false`.** Answer still renders, reasoning still collapses to "Worked for…" afterward. Gate green (typecheck, eslint, e2e 186/186).
- **"why clip"** = tool/command/browsed-page `<pre>` outputs are capped at `max-h-[320px]`/`[420px]` (`tool-block-view.tsx`) with internal scroll — **intentional** (stops giant dumps flooding the chat), offered to raise/remove on request. Not a bug.
- **Re-highlight perf (investigated, NOT a bug)**: `highlight-cache` keys by full code content, so streaming code blocks re-highlight from scratch each token (O(N²)). **Measured: 0 long-tasks** during a ~2.8 KB streaming code block → no main-thread jank at realistic sizes. Noted as a future optimization (skip highlight on the incomplete trailing block), not implemented (no evidence of user-visible cost).

### Iteration 20 (FEATURE: reasoning show/hide toggle — built + live-verified)
Built the optional 🟡 "quick toggle" for reasoning visibility the user hinted at. Global, client-only (localStorage `vllm-studio.agent.reasoningVisible`, default visible) + a `REASONING_VISIBILITY_CHANGED_EVENT` so every open pane re-renders via `useSyncExternalStore` — **no settings-service dependency** (deliberately avoids the in-flight settings refactor). New files: `messages/reasoning-pref.ts` (pure), `messages/use-reasoning-visible.ts` (hook), `tests/.../reasoning-pref.test.ts` (5 tests). Gated inside `AssistantActivityGroup` (filters reasoning segments; the group renders null when only reasoning remains; the "Working/Worked for…" divider still signals work). Toggle lives as a "Hide reasoning"/"Show reasoning" item in the session-header menu. Commit `94eaf19f` (feat(timeline)).
- ✅ **Gate green**: typecheck, eslint, madge cycles, ui-structure, **full e2e 186/186** (incl. the 5 new pref tests).
- ✅✅ **Live-verified on a freshly-rebuilt standalone QA app** (rebuilt `.next/standalone`, clean-restarted the QA Electron on CDP 9333): menu item present → click **Hide** removes the "Thought" disclosure while the answer stays → label flips to **Show** → click restores reasoning (reactive, no reload) → pref **persists across a full page reload** (`prefValue:"0"`, reasoning stayed hidden) → restored to default. Reasoning stays visible-while-streaming by default (the hard requirement) and the toggle only opts out.

### Iteration 19 (chat→chat switching robustness + reasoning replay/expand — 0 bugs)
- ✅✅ **"Clicking from one chat to another" (the user's headline reported bug)** — clicked through 4 sidebar sessions in sequence (RUNNING-essay `019ee302` → mountains `019ee2ef` → caching `019ee2c4` → back to RUNNING `019ee302`). **Every click loaded the correct session's own content** (URL sid matched, expected marker present, none blankish), including the **return visit** showing identical content (no stale/blank/wrong-session bleed). Confirms `b59040c3` (`navigateToSessionHref` soft-push-then-real-nav) holds across rapid sequential switches. The "acts like a new session / doesn't load data" report is fixed.
- ✅ **Reasoning preserved + expandable on REPLAY**: reopened the bat-and-ball reasoning session — reasoning is **collapsed by default** but its content is **present in the DOM** (`textContent`/`innerHTML` contain it, just hidden). The "Thought" disclosure is a native **`<details>/<summary>`**; clicking the `<summary>` expands it → reasoning becomes visible ("classic word problem / let me solve it step by step / let the ball cost…"). Keyboard-accessible, content not dropped on replay.
- 📝 **No global reasoning show/hide toggle** (the user's optional 🟡 ask). Only a recipe-level "Show the model's thinking process" (controls model *emission* at launch, `recipe-modal/tabs/tab-features.tsx`). Always-on streaming + per-message `<details>` already satisfy the hard requirement, so deferred as an enhancement (could be added as a pure client-side localStorage+CSS preference without touching the in-flight settings-service refactor — candidate if greenlit).

### Iteration 18 (reasoning-while-streaming + new-chat + 2-in-a-row — user's named flows)
- ✅ **Create a new chat**: clicked the New-chat link (`/agent?project=chats&new=1`) → fresh nonce URL `?new=mqluqffv`, composer present and focused.
- ✅✅ **Reasoning visible WHILE streaming (the user's #1, repeatedly-emphasized requirement)**: sent a reasoning task (bat-and-ball), polled the DOM ~0.7s through the stream — reasoning content grows **live** (`"…Let me solve it step by step. Let the ball cost $x. Then the bat costs $x + $1.00…"`) with `hasThought:true` + `streaming:true` throughout. Label transitions `Thinking`/`Working` (active) → `Thought` (settled); reasoning then **collapses** into a "Thought" disclosure as the answer begins (ZCode pattern, mainLen drops 744→408 at the fold). Final answer **correct**: "The ball costs 5 cents ($0.05)." No fix needed — works as designed.
- ✅ **2 messages in a row (same session)**: sent a follow-up ("multiply that answer by 20") → both user turns present and the 2nd turn streamed its own reasoning. (Display was then interrupted by an external navigation to `/` — see below — but the multi-turn **send + render** itself worked.)
- 📝 **LaTeX renders as raw `$$…$$` text** — known KaTeX-trimmed tradeoff (user removed the ~270 KB math bundle earlier). Decision, not a regression; not auto-fixed.
- 📝 **`glm-5-2-nvfp4-reap` launch fails** with `vllm serve: error: argument --moe-backend: invalid choice: 'b12x'` (valid host choices: aiter/auto/cutlass/deep_gemm/flashinfer_cutedsl/flashinfer_cutlass/flashinfer_trtllm). Recipe targets the B12X "Black Benediction" fork's vLLM; host vLLM rejects `b12x`. **The error now surfaces in the UI logs** (launch-stderr fix `8d3d7951` working — answers the earlier "logging not forwarded to console" question). Fixing the launch = changing the recipe's moe-backend (alters compute path → user's call per "validate output content").
- ✅ **No force-navigate on launch-error**: launch-progress is consumed as a **toast** (`features/dashboard/launch-toast.tsx`), no `router.push`/`location` in any consumer. The mid-test nav to `/` was **user-initiated** (active session), not a bug. Backed off active automation to avoid hijacking the live window.

### Iteration 17 (release smoke + clean verification sweep — 0 new bugs)
- ✅ **Local .dmg built + verified** (`vLLM Studio-0.2.9-arm64.dmg`, 243 MB, Developer-ID signed, `hdiutil verify` VALID). Local build only — no push / GitHub release / auto-update, per the user's choice. Built from HEAD `b59040c3`.
- ✅ **Search-dialog session nav (⌘K)** — REFUTES my own flagged concern that it might share the sidebar's `router.push` no-op bug. Clicked a different session from Search → URL changed (`019ee2bf…`→`019ee2ef…`) **and** the conversation content rendered (CHAT-B marker + mountains essay present, not empty). Search nav works end-to-end; the sidebar fix (`b59040c3`) did not need replicating here.
- ✅ **Section sweep (Status / Usage / Models / Plugins / Server)** — all render, zero `role="alert"` errors. **Usage `/usage` confirmed rich** (initial "blankish" reading was a false positive from measuring the outer non-laid-out `main` wrapper; inner scroll container has 2 KB of real analytics: 383.81M tokens, daily bar chart, 9-model performance table w/ latency/TTFT/speed). Screenshot captured.
- ✅ **Streaming controls present + wired** (`agent-composer-actions.tsx`): while streaming, the submit button morphs to a **Stop** (`onAbortTurn`, "Stop (Esc)"); with text in the box during a turn, **Steer** (interrupt+send) and **Queue (Tab)** are also offered. No missing control, no bug.
- **Net**: this pass found 0 new bugs and cleared 2 false alarms. Chat UX reads solid across nav, sections, and streaming controls.

### Iteration 16 (post-deploy smoke + reload-mid-stream)
- ✅ **Post-controller-deploy smoke** (live, glm-5.2): chat streams clean on the freshly-deployed controller — 3-item bullet list renders, reasoning ("Thought") present, **no leaked tool-call tags**, no errors. The streaming-path changes (tool-call-stream / tool-call-parser) deployed without regression.
- 🔧✅ **Reload mid-stream on a NEW chat no longer loses the turn** (`a44f5556`): the URL stayed `?…&new=<nonce>` after a turn started, so reloading restarted a blank chat and the conversation vanished from view. Root cause: `handlePiSessionIdChange` never updated the URL. **Fixed**: on piSessionId assignment, `history.replaceState` `?new=`→`?session=<piSessionId>` (invisible to Next's `useSearchParams`, so the running turn's nav effect never re-fires; side-chat pane excluded). **Verified live**: new chat → send → URL flips to `?session=…` at ~2s; reload → conversation reopens with its content (user msg + blocks, no blank-chat state). **And the live stream fully REATTACHES**: after reload the response keeps growing (56k→57k→57.8k chars, `streaming:true`) — the turn continues streaming into the reopened session, not frozen history. So reload-mid-stream now works end-to-end. The old Phase 3b "standalone buffers local SSE" concern doesn't bite here because the runtime-event reattach goes through the *proxied* (pass-through) controller events, not a locally-built SSE.

### Iteration 15 (split-pane / fork / close-pane / Search ⌘K)
- ✅ **Split-pane (Fork → second pane)**: header menu → Fork opens a second pane (1→2), both panes render the full session (table + composer), equal widths, clean side-by-side layout.
- ✅ **Close-pane**: the right pane's Close returns to a single pane (2→1) with content intact.
- ✅ **Search ⌘K**: opens a command dialog ("Search destinations, sessions, projects, or models…"); typing "table" returns the 2 matching sessions by title with ↑↓/↵ hints. Works.
- ⚠️ **FORK SEMANTICS — finding (not fixed, needs a decision)**: "Fork from this point" (GitFork icon) creates two **mirrored views of the same session**, not an independent branch — sending in one pane updates BOTH identically (verified: a "RIGHT-PANE-OK" turn sent in the right pane appeared in the left too). Root cause: `copySession` keeps the source `piSessionId`, so both panes are the same pi SDK session. A true fork needs pi-SDK session branching (clone server-side history into a new session); without it, fork can only mirror (current) or start a context-less new session. **Options for the user:** (a) accept it as a "split view" and relabel "Fork" → "Open in split"; (b) implement real SDK session forking (riskier, session-identity area). DEFERRED pending your call.

### Iteration 14 (headline bug confirmed fixed on replay + load-old-session)
- ✅✅ **Markdown table on REPLAY (the user's #1 reported bug)**: generated a 5-row table live (renders as a real `<table>`, 6×3), then navigated away and reopened the settled session by piSessionId → table re-renders **identically, not mangled** (clean NAME/YEAR/PARADIGM, all rows). Screenshot proof. Confirms the audit fixes (`99c2c068` block-event verbatim append + `20116542` replay snapshot rebuild) hold end-to-end. No fix needed.
- ✅ **Load old session**: opening a settled session by URL (`?session=<piSessionId>`) loads its full canonical history (messages + reasoning). Earlier "empty session" confusion was a stale/invalid id + agent-browser synthetic-click quirk, not a bug.
- **Feature saturation note**: vetted edit/regenerate (risky — frontend truncation desyncs from the loaded pi SDK session history), "Launch model" affordance (risky — restarts live GPU), KaTeX math (≈270KB, user trimmed bundle before), message timestamps (`nowLabel()` is computed at replay time → shows reopen time, not original send time — needs replay-timestamp plumbing first). Candidate clean features if greenlit: export-chat-as-markdown; replay-correct timestamps.

### Iteration 13 (steer + tool turns + 503-shape fix)
- ✅ **Steer mid-stream**: started a long count, sent a steer message while streaming → accepted (composer stays editable + Send active during a turn), turn settled clean, no error, composer ready. No break.
- ✅ **Tool turns**: "use list_files…" → model ran a tool (rendered as a **"Ran 1 command" / "Ran ls -A"** collapsible activity disclosure, alongside a "Thought" reasoning disclosure), then a clean markdown answer ("13 items… 11 files / 2 directories") with inline code intact. Activity grouping (ZCode "worked for X" pattern) renders correctly.
- 🔧 **503 model-not-running message** (commit `dd0b19a1`, **needs controller deploy**): the chat proxy returned its clear "Model X is running; Y is not. Launch it…" message in FastAPI `{detail}` shape, which the pi/OpenAI SDK ignores → bare "503 status code (no body)". Now returns OpenAI shape (`error.message`/`type`/`code`) + keeps `detail`. Extracted `modelNotRunningError()`, +2 unit tests. **Live re-verify after deploy** (3 controller fixes now pending: `fd118a6c`, `a798ebd0`, `dd0b19a1`).
