# vLLM Studio — Full UX Test Checklist

_Living checklist for the chat-session QA loop. Tested against the rebuilt Electron app (QA profile, CDP 9333) on the live `glm-5.2` backend. Status: ⬜ untested · ✅ pass · ❌ fail (issue) · 🔧 fixed · ⏭️ blocked._

Legend for "layer": which subsystem the flow exercises (Parse = content pipeline, Trans = transport/SSE, Sess = session lifecycle, UI = rendering).

---

## A. Session lifecycle

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Layer | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| A1 | New chat | Click "New chat" | Empty composer, fresh session id, title "New session" | Sess | ⬜ |
| A2 | First message creates session | Type + send | User bubble + assistant bubble appear; title derives from prompt | Sess | ⬜ |
| A3 | Switch chat A→B | Click another session in sidebar | B's transcript loads, A's preserved, no bleed | Sess | ⬜ |
| A4 | Switch back B→A | Click A again | A's full transcript intact (incl. tables/reasoning) | Sess/Parse | ⬜ |
| A5 | Switch to a still-streaming chat | Start turn in A, switch to B, switch back to A | A still streaming or settled correctly, no dup/loss | Trans/Parse | ⬜ |
| A6 | Rename session | Session options → rename | Title updates in sidebar + tab | Sess | ⬜ |
| A7 | Pin / unpin session | Toggle pin | Stays pinned across reloads | Sess | ⬜ |
| A8 | Delete session | Delete | Removed from sidebar; active switches to another | Sess | ⬜ |
| A9 | Reopen after delete-all | Delete all, new chat | Clean empty starter state | Sess | ⬜ |

## B. Messaging & streaming

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Layer | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| B1 | Send single message | Type + Send | Streams token-by-token, settles to idle | Trans/Parse | ⬜ |
| B2 | **Reasoning visible while streaming** | Send a reasoning prompt | "Thinking" expands and shows reasoning text LIVE, collapses to "Thought · Worked for Xs" when done | UI/Parse | 🔧 (fix applied, retest) |
| B3 | Markdown table renders | Ask for a table | GFM table with rows/cols, not collapsed | Parse/UI | ✅ (confirmed live) |
| B4 | Code block renders | Ask for code | Fenced block, syntax highlight, copy button | UI | ⬜ |
| B5 | Send 2 messages in a row | Send, wait, send again | Two turns, correct order, second targets a new bubble | Sess/Parse | ⬜ |
| B6 | Steer mid-stream (follow-up) | Send, then send again WHILE streaming | Second message queues/steers; tokens land in the right bubble | Sess/Parse | ⬜ |
| B7 | Stop generation | Click Stop mid-stream | Stream halts, status idle, partial content kept | Trans/Sess | ⬜ |
| B8 | Long multi-paragraph answer | Ask for long prose | Paragraph/blank-line boundaries preserved | Parse | ⬜ |
| B9 | Tool-using turn | Prompt that triggers a tool | Activity group shows tool call + result; collapses after | Parse/UI | ⬜ |
| B10 | Reasoning + tool interleave | Reasoning then tool then text | Reasoning under activity, answer as content, order correct | Parse | ⬜ |
| B11 | Empty / whitespace answer | Edge prompt | No phantom blank bubble | Parse | ⬜ |

## C. Transport / reload / reconnect

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Layer | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| C1 | Reload after a settled turn | Finish a turn, reload | Full transcript rehydrates (tables/reasoning intact) | Trans/Parse | ⬜ |
| C2 | **Reload mid-stream (reattach)** | Reload WHILE streaming | Turn reattaches and continues/settles; no empty session | Trans/Parse | ❌ (empty session — standalone SSE buffering, Phase 3b) |
| C3 | Backend blip | Kill/restart controller mid-turn | Session reconnects or idles with visible error, no infinite spin | Trans | ⬜ |
| C4 | `/events` system stream | Watch Status page over time | GPU/log stream keeps flowing, no `Controller already closed` | Trans | ❌ (proxy double-close error) |
| C5 | Navigate away & back during stream | Status → back to chat mid-stream | Stream still live or settled, cursor correct | Trans/Sess | ⬜ |

## D. Navigation & panes

| # | Flow | Steps | Expected | Layer | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------|-------|--------|

## Issues found (running log)

1. **B2 reasoning hidden while streaming** — outer `ActivityDisclosure` (`session-pane-block-router.tsx`) defaulted collapsed (`expanded=false`), hiding the inner reasoning that already auto-opens while active. **Fix applied:** `expanded = userExpanded ?? live` so it auto-expands while streaming and collapses when settled. _Retest after rebuild._
2. **C2 reload mid-stream → empty session** — standalone embedded server buffers the locally-built `/api/agent/runtime/events` SSE; reattach gets nothing. **Phase 3b** (snapshot+cursor JSON-GET resume).
3. **C4 `/events` proxy `Controller is already closed`** — `/api/proxy/[...path]` stream controller closed twice. **🔧 Fixed** (idempotent `safeClose` + `finished` flag; client disconnect is now a no-op, not a logged error). Uncommitted in working tree (file also carries the pre-existing `settings-service` import refactor — commit together).

## Iteration log

### Iteration 1 (live, rebuilt Electron, glm-5.2)
**Verified pass:** A1 New chat (fresh empty session) · B2 **Reasoning visible while streaming** 🔧✅ (committed `86c0c089`; "Thinking" block auto-expands and streams full internal reasoning live, collapses to "Worked for Xs" on settle) · B3 Table renders live ✅ · sessions list in sidebar (under collapsed "Chats" section) · 7-day history persists.
**Fixed this iteration:** B2 reasoning-while-streaming (committed) · C4 proxy double-close (working tree).
**Notes / minor:** the sidebar "Chats" section defaults **collapsed** — recent chats are hidden until you expand it (possible UX nit: surface recent chats by default). Test-harness: re-snapshot before each click (refs go stale after navigation).
**Environment caveat:** the isolated QA profile (`~/Library/Application Support/vLLM Studio QA`) was seeded with backend config but **not `chats.db`**, so reload/persistence flows (C1, C2) can't be tested faithfully yet — next iteration seeds `chats.db` (additive copy) for a true environment.

**Next iteration queue:** faithful env (seed chats.db) → A3/A4 switch chats + load-old-session table render (replay path) → B5 send-2-in-a-row → B6 steer mid-stream → B7 stop → C1 reload-settled → C2/Phase 3b reload-mid-stream reattach (standalone SSE transport) → D/E/F navigation, model picker, panels.

### Iteration 2 (sidebar bugs — user-reported)
User report: switching sessions struggles · no blue-circle notifications · leave/rejoin unreliable · follow-up prompts bug out.
**Fixed + verified:**
- **B5 follow-up after settle 🔧✅** (committed `a75768b1`): a 2nd message used to stall (added but no turn started). Root cause — `runtimeAcceptsControl` (chat-pane) routed it as a *steer* because the runtime still reports `active=true` after a turn settles (SDK session stays loaded), steering an idle agent → dropped. Fix: gate steer on the LOCAL turn being in-flight (`tab.status` running/starting). Verified live: msg1→settle→msg2 now answers.
**Foundation committed (needs more):**
- **Blue-circle unseen dot** (committed `aca5b07f`): `unseen` flag on active-session snapshot + sidebar dot. Correct, but doesn't fire in the common single-pane flow (see root cause below).
**Root cause of the remaining sidebar bugs (verified live):** navigating to another chat **replaces the single pane and drops the previous running session from the active set** — it shows **no spinner, no dot, and isn't listed** while it keeps running server-side. This is the through-line for "no notifications," "switching struggles," and "leave/rejoin unreliable." A background turn becomes invisible and must reattach on return (which is also broken in standalone — Phase 3b).
**Next (core fix):** surface running / just-finished sessions on sidebar rows from the runtime-list poll (`listRuntimeSessions`) — a session running server-side gets a spinner, a just-finished one gets the unseen dot — independent of whether it's open in a pane. Then verify switch-away → indicator → switch-back → content (with faithful env + Phase 3b reattach).

### Iteration 3 (user-reported: reorder + navbar)
User report: "opened chat, switched session, got lost — the sessions reordered and I lost the original. Do not reorder based on what's open. Opening a sidechat via navbar is awful, it breaks."
**Fixed + verified:**
- **Sidebar reorder-on-open 🔧✅** (committed `5acf5871`): opening a session promoted it to the top because open sessions rendered in a separate block ABOVE history. Now ONE list ordered by stable start time; an open session keeps its position (anchored to its original history start time so opening never changes its sort key). Verified live: a session at position 7 stayed at the bottom (pos 8) when opened instead of jumping to #1; no duplicate rows (two same-looking codex rows confirmed to be distinct session ids).
**Still to do (needs reproduction):**
- **"Opening a sidechat via navbar breaks"** — maps to the split-pane / `OpenSession`/`splitTab` path (`pane-controller.ts:226-421`). Vague; reproduce live (open a session into a split/side pane via the top navbar) and characterize the break before fixing.

### Iteration 4 (user-reported: abort error + module-not-found)
User report: "request aborted shouldn't be an error — it's throwing an error which is wrong" + agent error `Cannot find module …/pi-ai/dist/providers/openai-completions.js`.
**Fixed + verified live (committed `df6af425`):**
- **B7 abort ≠ error 🔧✅** — a turn ending `stopReason:"aborted"` (Stop pressed / navigated away) was treated as a failure: tools→error, "Assistant turn aborted." event block, `session.error` set. Now settles cleanly (tools→done, no error block, no session error, partial content kept). Only `stopReason:"error"` is a failure. Regression test added (63 green). **Verified live:** pressed Stop mid-turn → clean settle, no error block, composer ready (screenshot).
- **Standalone module-not-found 🔧✅** — `pi-ai/register-builtins.js` pulls providers in dynamically; Next's tracer omitted `openai-completions.js` intermittently → agent threw at runtime. Added `outputFileTracingIncludes` for the whole `pi-ai/dist` (top-level + nested under pi-coding-agent). **Verified:** `openai-completions.js` + full 18-provider set present in `.next/standalone` after build.
**Note:** the user's in-app prompt ("go to ~/.codex/config.toml and remove the pi ai gateway; identify codex-app computer-use/plugin issues") is a task for the *agent* to run once it works — not a code change here. Once these land, that prompt should execute instead of erroring.

### Iteration 5 (navbar "sidechat breaks" — root-caused)
**Confirmed root cause (code-traced):** the **Side chat** (right-panel secondary `ChatPane`, `paneId="computer-side-chat"`, launched from the computer-panel "Side chat" card → `onOpenSideChat`) holds its session in **local `useState`** in `agent-browser-panel.tsx` (`sideChatSession`), never dispatched to the workspace store. The runtime controller is a singleton bound in `use-workspace.ts` with `getSessions: () => sessionsRef.current` and driven by `reconcile(sessionsRef.current)` — **workspace sessions only**. So the side-chat's `runtimeSessionId` is never reconciled → no SSE attachment → its turns POST `/turn` but never stream back → it "breaks" (message sent, no response). Not a render crash (`createSideChatSession` builds a valid session via `makeFreshTab`).
**Fix (NOT yet done — architectural, ~medium):** make the controller reconcile the active side-chat session alongside workspace sessions (e.g. lift it into a shared ref/the workspace set, or have the side-chat engine register its session for subscription). Needs the faithful env + the exact user repro to verify the streaming end-to-end. **Deferred pending user steer** — it's a real but non-trivial change and risky to land blind.

### Iteration 6 (Background notifications — user chose this)
**Done (committed `bce0d11b` + `a2329010`; live verify pending build):** the runtime controller now exposes the poll's **active-session-id set** (`subscribeActiveRuntimeIds`/`getActiveRuntimeIds`) plus an **unseen-finished set** (`getUnseenFinishedIds`/`markRuntimeSeen`) via a tiny `useSyncExternalStore`-stable store — no redundant poll, no change to the core streaming/commit path. The sidebar's **history rows** now show: a **working spinner** while a session runs in the background (independent of pane membership), and an **accent "unseen" dot** when a background turn just finished (cleared when the session re-runs or you open it). Directly addresses "you don't get notifications (blue circle)" + "switching away makes it invisible." 94 tests green.
**Live verify (partial):** the working spinner DID render on a sidebar row for a background turn; clean active-vs-background confirmation was blocked by agent-browser ref instability (kept landing on the wrong session). Code is traced-correct + unit-tested. **Manual check recommended:** start a turn in one chat, switch to a clearly different chat, look for the spinner on the first chat's sidebar row.
**Gap found (real):** a brand-NEW backgrounded session **vanishes from the sidebar** — it's not in the server history list yet and it left the workspace active set, so there's no row to indicate on. The spinner/dot only attach to sessions that already have a row (e.g. re-running an old chat). The common "new chat → run → switch away" case still goes invisible. **Full fix = the session-lifecycle change** (keep a backgrounded-but-running session visible, e.g. a "recently backgrounded" set or refetch history on runtime change) — bigger, deferred.

### Iteration 7 (newlines collapsing — user-reported)
User: "we are missing new lines i saw it make a list but all without newlines."
**Fixed (committed `fd118a6c`; needs controller deploy to go live):** the **controller**'s `normalizeTextDelta` cumulative-snapshot check used `text.length >= previous.text.length && startsWith` — a delta that EQUALS the accumulated text (a second `"\n"` after a first `"\n"`, i.e. a model opening with a blank line before a list) was misread as a cumulative snapshot, dropped, AND flipped the stream into snapshot mode, mangling the rest → list on one line. Fix: strict `>` for cumulative + `text.trim() !== ""` guard on the replay-suppress. Model-dependent (glm-5.2 didn't show it; others do). +2 regression tests; 51/51 controller tests green. **The frontend was already lossless here** (appendDelta verbatim + snapshot path); this was the last of the 3 "guessing" layers from the audit. **DEPLOY: `scripts/deploy-remote.sh controller` (restarts the model).**

## Remaining big items (need user steer / faithful env)
1. **Side-chat streaming** — integrate side-chat session into runtime reconcile (CORE controller change; high risk, deferred).
2. **Phase 3b transport** — cursor+snapshot JSON-GET resume so reload-mid-stream reattaches in the standalone build (CORE transport; high risk).
