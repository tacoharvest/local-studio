# Professionalize Loop — Mission Ledger

**Started:** 2026-07-12 18:05 EDT · **Deadline:** 2026-07-13 06:05 EDT (12h)
**Branch:** `loop/professionalize` (off origin/main @ 41a0bc45) · **Mode:** self-paced /loop, autonomous

## Mission
Turn the repo into something more professional: improve code quality, remove trash, update docs,
clean package.json, find and debug bugs, Effect V4 everywhere (controller), extract components
and logic, keep code DRY.

## Standing rules
- All work lands on `loop/professionalize`; push after each iteration. **Never merge to main**
  (semantic-release fires on main) — final PR at the end.
- **No deploys to pop-os** (controller restart kills the running model). Repo-only work.
- Never delete non-git data files. Deleting dead *tracked* code is fine (git preserves it).
- Gates per iteration: controller → `bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run test:unit`;
  frontend → `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` (+ targeted tests); full `npm run check`
  every ~4 iterations and before the final PR.
- Commit style: conventional commits, one concern per commit.
- Respect the instrument-sheet aesthetic; no visual redesigns.
- SKIP lists from previous loops are binding (controller-simplification items 6–8: do not re-propose).

## Backlog (priority order; ✔ = done, ▶ = in progress)
1. ✔ I1a: Carry over verified keepalive fix (a89bc95b → e956b021).
2. I1b: **Gates actually enforced** — add root `check:contracts` + `check:structure` job to CI;
   prune stale `environments.ts` entry in validate-shared-contracts.mjs; fix stale AGENTS.md
   test-runner doc (`tsx --test` → `bun test scripts`).
3. I2: **Trash removal** — empty `cli/` stub dir (tracked refs), knip/depcheck dead-export sweep
   in frontend+controller, dead `PROGRESS.md`?, stale docs/mockups review (keep mockups, they're design refs).
4. I3: **package.json cleaning** — root+frontend+controller: stale scripts, unused deps
   (depcheck), align engines fields, dedupe config (jscpd threshold drift, knip hoisting → issue #146).
5. I4: **Test story** — rename `tests/frontend/e2e` (it's node:test, not e2e), standardize on
   bun:test, add frontend unit tests to root `check`, document in AGENTS.md.
6. I5: **AggregatedSession + contracts seam** — move cross-boundary types to shared/contracts;
   prune validator whitelist.
7. I6: **Collapse per-backend upgrade routes** into `/runtime/:backend/upgrade` (issue #145);
   split engines/routes.ts god-router by concern (recipes / lifecycle / downloads / runtime).
8. I7: **DRY sweeps** — duplicate `ps` parsers (process-utilities vs process-manager);
   the two SSE keepalive implementations (http/sse.ts vs chat-completions-stream.ts);
   per-field route validators (rig-routes hand-rolled parsers → shared request-validation helpers).
9. I8: **Effect V4 deepening (controller)** — controller already uses effect@4.0.0-beta.90 in
   core/command.ts; migrate promise-tangles (engine-coordinator setActiveRecipe phases,
   download-manager, runtime jobs) to Effect where it *reduces* complexity. No wholesale rewrite.
10. I9: **EngineSpec deepening** — move per-engine command/probe/install/runtime-info bodies into
    specs/*.ts; unify the 4 "what's installed" paths on RuntimeTarget discovery.
11. I10: **Frontend session-status module** — single `settleSession`/`startTurn`/`isSessionWorking`
    in features/agent/runtime; replace the 3+ inline copies (controller L137, engine L213, applier).
12. I11: **defineAgentRoute scaffold** — collapse ~25 in-process agent API route boilerplates.
13. I12: **Component extraction** — largest frontend files (query for >400-line .tsx) into
    model/view pairs per existing convention.
14. I13: **Docs refresh** — README accuracy pass, AGENTS.md route map vs reality, controller
    route map in memory vs actual, CONTEXT.md seed (domain vocabulary) if time allows.
15. I14: **Model-profile table** — unify launch parsers (model-runtime-defaults.ts) + streaming
    quirks (proxy/reasoning.ts) behind one table. CAREFUL: decode-path — verify content fields,
    not just green tests.
16. Final: full `npm run check`, write PR summary, open PR to main, PushNotification.

## Iteration log
- **I1 (18:05)**: Branch created. Recovered keepalive fix via cherry-pick (e956b021) after a
  stash mishap (old stash@{0} briefly popped; resurrected files parked in scratchpad/old-stash-files;
  stash entry preserved untouched). I1b: gates CI job added, stale validator entry pruned,
  AGENTS.md test doc fixed (4a3034a6).
- **I2 (18:20)**: Trash + config alignment: PROGRESS.md removed, frontend depcheck → .depcheckrc.json,
  jscpd minTokens aligned at 200 (controller has 0 clones at stricter bar). Issue #146 closed.
  knip clean in both packages — dead-export debt is already policed by gates.
- **I3 (18:30)**: Test story: tests/frontend/e2e → tests/frontend/regression (they're node:test module
  regressions, not e2e); scripts/CI/README/AGENTS renamed to match; frontend unit tests added to root
  check:frontend. 236/236 pass. NOTE: AGENTS.md forbids --no-verify — loop now commits/pushes with
  hooks enabled (pushes batched since pre-push runs full check:quality).
- **I4 (18:35)**: AggregatedSession defined once in shared/agent/session-summary.ts (extends
  SessionSummary — the old feature-side copy silently omitted cwd/provider/archived/archivedAt that
  the server actually sends); route + 3 UI consumers import the canonical type.
- NOTE for final handoff: AGENTS.md requires a desktop rebuild after frontend changes ship — owed
  once the loop PR merges, not per-iteration.
- **I5 (18:50)**: Upgrade-route collapse (054c48b5): five per-backend handlers → one
  /runtime/:backend/upgrade validated against RUNTIME_JOB_BACKENDS; frontend's five
  upgradeXRuntime methods → one upgradeRuntime(); dropped stale RuntimeCommandPayload
  (command/args have been rejected server-side since the hardening). #145 closed.
- **I6 (19:05)**: process-inventory.ts (02c4dcf7): three independent ps parsers unified behind
  the ProcessRunner seam; listProcesses/buildProcessTree/listProcessTable all derive from
  listProcessInventory(). 139 unit + 114 integration green.
- **I7 (19:35) — deliberate SKIPS (do not re-propose):**
  - SSE keepalive unification: chat path's keepalive is intentionally different from
    http/sse.ts withSseHeartbeat (immediate first byte before upstream connect = the Cloudflare
    502 fix; fixed-interval vs idle-gated; byte-aligned frames vs strings). Unifying restructures
    the hottest Cloudflare-tuned path to save ~30 lines. Not worth the regression risk.
  - rig-routes Schema rewrite: validators are local, precise, merge-with-current semantics with
    UI-facing error messages; Schema conversion is churn, not depth.
- **I8 (19:50)**: session-status module (8e8d83df): SessionStatus union tightened (was `| string`
  = no checking; "done" was a tool-block status leaked into the union); isWorkingStatus() replaces
  session-index's stringly re-derivation; settleTurn/settleTurnFinalizingTools replace 5 copies;
  SessionTab.status shares the union. All suites green.
  KNOWN QUIRK (pre-existing): `bun test ../tests/frontend scripts` combined in ONE invocation
  fails 1 assertion (build-agent-session-options FRONTEND_BASE) — order/module-resolution
  cross-talk; CI and all scripts run the suites separately, where both are green.
- **I9 (20:45… actually 18:48 — clock notes below)**: EngineSpec deepening, mechanical half
  (d350a867): vllm allowlist filter + Docker JIT wrapper and llama.cpp binary-resolution/
  serialization moved from backend-builder into their specs; backend-builder 413→279 lines,
  now engine-agnostic (generic serialization seam + shared docker-run shape). All gates green.
  DESIGN-SCOPED SKIP: unifying the four GET /runtime/<backend> info paths — sglang/llamacpp
  routes use RuntimeTarget discovery while specs use probe chains; they can genuinely disagree,
  and /runtime/vllm has a different (frontend-typed) response shape. Needs a design decision +
  live verification; folds into the multi-model/#171 work. Do not flip routes blind.
- **I10 (19:15)**: docs accuracy (AGENTS.md pi-runtime paths → services/agent-runtime, 3090 gone,
  Zod→Effect Schema, CLI/voice refs dropped) + NEW chat-proxy end-to-end tests
  (chat-proxy-forwarding.test.ts): upstream forwarding, keepalive-first-byte SSE contract,
  model_not_running 503 gate. That coverage did not exist.
- **I11 (19:30)**: chat handler decomposed into parseChatBody/resolveChatUpstream/
  gateOnRunningModel/normalizeCompletionChoices closure stages (behavior pinned by I10 tests;
  117/117 integration green). Recipe CRUD: malformed JSON now 400s (ctx.req.json() threw outside
  the try → 500). SCOPED: Effect-ifying engine-coordinator's setActiveRecipe deliberately NOT
  attempted autonomously — that's the machinery keeping models alive; Effect adoption stays at
  boundaries where the repo already uses it (Schema at config/speech/recipes, command effects,
  coalescer).
- **I12 (20:00)**: chatterbox modal 750→240 (09947a97) and left sidebar 548→212 (0607f52a),
  both verbatim-move extractions verified byte-identical markup, all gates green.
  ⚠️ INCIDENT, resolved: an agent stash cycle over the 15-entry stash pile resurrected an old
  half-finished "move pi-session usage scanning into agent-runtime" WIP into the tree (broken
  imports, 2× TS2307). Quarantined — full patch + untracked files preserved in the session
  scratchpad (quarantine-usage-wip/) and the original stash entry is untouched; affected paths
  restored to HEAD; stale .next/types purged. NOTE for future loops: the stash pile is a trap —
  never `git stash pop` on this repo without checking `git stash list` first.
- **I13 (19:20)**: engines god-router split (registerEngineRoutes → recipe/lifecycle/download/
  runtime registrars + observed-process factory; routes.ts 387→12). All controller gates green.
- **I14 (19:25)**: CONTEXT.md seeded — repo domain language (recipes/engines/targets/launch-state,
  proxy stages, session/turn/pane, contracts/gates) per the architecture-skill discipline.
- **I15 (19:33)**: git-diff-panel 544→173 (+workflow/diff-view sections, DiffViewMode alias) and
  recipe-modal 526→126 (+model hook — order preserved — source helpers, summary, footer).
  All gates green. FLAKE NOTE: one combined `bun test scripts` run showed 2 fails that vanished
  on immediate rerun (timing-sensitive usage-policy tests); two consecutive greens after.
- **I16 (19:50)**: tools/selection-persistence.ts single-owns the ToolSelection wire shape
  (no discrepancies found between the two sides; persisted JSON byte-identical; type now honest).
- **I17 (19:55)**: full `npm run check` + `test:integration` green end-to-end → **PR #181 opened**
  (loop continues appending). FLAGGED FOR OWNER: landing-page.tsx and marketing-page.tsx are
  ~90% clones and BOTH routed (/landing+/docs vs /agents+/download) — consolidation is the
  pending marketing product decision, not an autonomous call.
- **I18 (20:10)**: google-account-modal 501→263 (+setup/connected/load-state sections, 655b38e7).
- **OUTAGE (20:20–06:38)**: the API session limit cut the night short — the use-setup extraction
  agent died mid-verification and no wakeups could fire until morning. Nothing was lost: the
  orphaned extraction was re-verified at 06:38 (all gates green) and committed.
- **WRAP (06:45)**: deadline passed; final push (27 commits on PR #181), loop stopped.
  Owed after PR review/merge: desktop rebuild per AGENTS.md; owner decisions on
  landing-vs-marketing consolidation and the GET /runtime info-path unification design.
