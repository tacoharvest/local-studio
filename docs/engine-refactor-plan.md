# Engine system refactor + /environments — progress ledger

Autonomous, multi-session initiative (30-min cron loop, unattended). Read this file
first at the start of every iteration; update it before ending each iteration.
Never leave the repo broken — all local gates (`npm run check:static` in
`frontend/`, `bun run typecheck`/tests in `controller/`) must pass before an
iteration ends.

## Origin

User wants two things:
1. A new `/environments` page: create Docker containers for recipes with pinned
   `vllm`/`sglang`/`llama.cpp`/`mlx` versions.
2. Our controller's engine system (`controller/src/modules/engines/*`,
   `controller/src/modules/models/recipes/*`) reworked to be as clean as
   `~/exo-cli` (real path — `~/ai/exo-cli` is a red herring research bundle,
   not a CLI).
3. A full repo-wide code-quality sweep (see "Sweep checklist" below).

## exo-cli reference findings (`/Users/sero/exo-cli`, github 0xSero/exo-spark)

- TS/Bun CLI, ~2000 LOC total across ~30 files, **none over 126 lines**.
- **No Docker anywhere.** Engines are installed into a shared venv (vLLM/SGLang/MLX
  as pinned pip wheels, e.g. `vllm==0.23.0`) or built from source with a pinned
  git branch (llama.cpp: `git clone --branch step3.7 ...`). Only one version
  live at a time per install root.
- Clean `EngineSpec` interface (`src/engines/types.ts`):
  ```ts
  export interface EngineSpec {
    readonly id: EngineId;
    readonly bin: string;
    readonly healthPath: string;
    readonly platforms: readonly NodeJS.Platform[];
    readonly serveCommand: (recipe: ModelRecipe, port: number) => readonly string[];
    readonly install: Effect.Effect<void, ShError>;
    readonly env?: () => Record<string, string>;
  }
  ```
  Flat registry `Record<EngineId, EngineSpec>` in `src/engines/registry.ts`,
  `engineFor(recipe)` lookup. Each adapter (`vllm.ts`/`llama.ts`/`sglang.ts`/`mlx.ts`)
  is 30-50 lines.
- Recipes (`ModelRecipe`) are plain interfaces, one TS file per model×device combo,
  aggregated into `src/models/catalog.ts`. Type-checked at build time, not JSON.
- Built on Effect (v4-beta) throughout for shell exec/spawn/HTTP.
- Serving lifecycle (`serving/instance.ts`) is ~20 lines: check-alive, reap-stale,
  allocate port, spawn, write instance record, health-wait. No hidden cross-cutting
  logic.

**Implication for us:** "work more like exo-cli" = adopt the *shape* (tiny
`EngineSpec`-style interface, flat registry, small single-purpose adapter files,
Effect end-to-end) for our EXISTING vLLM/SGLang/llama.cpp/MLX process-launch
logic. It does NOT mean copy Docker usage — exo-cli has none. The Docker
requirement is a **new, orthogonal** capability (`/environments`) we design
ourselves: pinned-version containerized recipes, separate from the native
process-launch path exo-cli's pattern informs.

## Part A — `/environments` (new feature)

Goal: a page where a user picks a recipe + explicit pinned engine version
(vllm/sglang/llama.cpp) and we run it as a Docker container using the
**official upstream image** for that version, instead of the native-process
launch path.

**2026-07-01 (iter 5) important design correction:** the codebase already has
a Docker-run mechanism (`backend-builder.ts`'s `wrapVllmInDocker`,
`extra_args.docker_image` on a recipe, `process-manager.ts`'s docker
stop/kill, `runtime-targets.ts`'s docker image/container discovery,
`logs-routes.ts`'s docker log streaming) — but it is a **narrow, vLLM-only
escape hatch for one specific custom-forked image** (`CONTAINER_VLLM_BIN =
"/opt/venv/bin/vllm"` is that image's specific file layout, not a generic
convention). Generalizing it by guessing container paths for sglang/
llama.cpp would have been irresponsible — instead, researched each engine's
**real, official, published Docker image** via WebSearch/WebFetch (sourced,
not guessed):

- **vLLM** — `vllm/vllm-openai` (Docker Hub). `ENTRYPOINT ["vllm", "serve"]`.
  Plain semver tags for CUDA (`v0.11.0`), accelerator-suffixed variants exist
  too (`v0.24.0-cu129-ubuntu2404`). Container command = just the engine flags
  (`--model`, `--host`, `--port`, ...) — no subcommand needed, the entrypoint
  already runs `vllm serve`.
  Sources: [vLLM Docker docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/deployment/docker/),
  [vllm/vllm-openai tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/vllm/vllm-openai/tags).
- **SGLang** — `lmsysorg/sglang` (Docker Hub). No fixed server entrypoint —
  tags are always accelerator-suffixed (`v0.4.7-cu124`,
  `v0.4.10.post2-rocm700-mi35x`), and the container command must explicitly
  invoke `python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path ... --host ... --port ...`.
  Source: [lmsysorg/sglang](https://hub.docker.com/r/lmsysorg/sglang),
  [sglang docker compose](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docker/compose.yaml).
- **llama.cpp** — `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp`. Versioned by **build number**,
  not semver (e.g. `server-cuda-b9853`, `server-b9853` for CPU,
  `server-rocm-b{n}`/`server-vulkan-b{n}`/`server-openvino-b{n}` for other
  accelerators). The `server*` tag variants already run `llama-server` as
  their entrypoint — container command is just `-m <path> --host --port`.
  Sources: [llama.cpp docker.md](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/docker.md),
  [ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp packages](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pkgs/container/llama.cpp).
- **MLX is intentionally excluded.** MLX's entire value proposition is native
  Apple Silicon Metal acceleration; Docker on macOS runs containers inside a
  Linux VM with no GPU/Metal passthrough, so a "containerized MLX
  environment" would run with no acceleration at all — not useful. No
  official MLX Docker image exists either. `EnvironmentEngineId` is
  `Extract<EngineBackend, "vllm" | "sglang" | "llamacpp">`.

Progress:

- [x] **Safe prerequisite refactor**: extracted `buildDockerRunArguments`
      (renamed per `unicorn/prevent-abbreviations`) out of `wrapVllmInDocker`
      in `backend-builder.ts` — the generic `docker run` invocation shape
      (container naming, `--gpus all --network host --ipc host`, env
      forwarding, model bind-mount) is now a shared, parameterized helper
      (`extraEnv`/`extraVolumes` per-call), with `wrapVllmInDocker` reduced to
      supplying its own JIT-cache-specific env/volume on top. Verified
      byte-for-byte identical behavior against the existing
      `vllm-docker-image.test.ts` (4/4 pass unchanged).
- [x] **`EnvironmentSpec` foundation** (new `controller/src/modules/
      environments/` module, built on the research above — NOT the
      vllm-only escape hatch):
  - `types.ts` (16 lines) — `EnvironmentEngineId`, `EnvironmentAccelerator`,
    `EnvironmentImageSpec`.
  - `image-registry.ts` (32 lines) — `resolveEnvironmentImage({engineId,
    version, variant})`: pure function mapping a pinned version + optional
    accelerator/build variant to the exact official image reference per
    engine, using the real tag shapes above (no invented defaults for
    variants that vary per engine — caller supplies the exact suffix).
  - `container-command.ts` (49 lines) — `buildEnvironmentContainerCommand
    (engineId, recipe, image)`: builds the per-engine container CMD (reusing
    the existing `Recipe` type — no forked recipe concept, per the original
    plan) and wraps it via the shared `buildDockerRunArguments`.
  - New test file `tests/controller/integration/environments-docker-images
    .test.ts` (9 tests, all passing) covering image resolution for all 3
    engines + variants, and container-command shape for all 3 engines
    (entrypoint assumptions, model bind-mount, served-model-name handling).
  - `npm run test:integration` (108/108, up from 99), `test:unit` (4/4),
    lint, typecheck, jscpd, depcheck all green. `knip` flags the 3 new files
    as "unused" — expected and correct: nothing wires them into routes yet
    (next step below), not dead code.
- [x] **Persistence** (2026-07-01): `recipe-store.ts` turned out to be
      **SQLite-backed** (via `openSqliteDatabase`/`bun:sqlite`), not JSON-file
      as originally assumed above — corrected before building anything.
      `environments/types.ts` now has `Environment`/`EnvironmentId` (branded,
      matching `RecipeId`'s pattern) — `{id, name, recipeId, engineId,
      version, variant, createdAt, updatedAt}`. No `image`/`status` field:
      the image is *derived* on demand via `resolveEnvironmentImage`, not
      stored (avoids a second source of truth), and container run/build
      status is a runtime concern like a recipe's running state — not part
      of the definition record. `environment-serializer.ts` uses Effect v4
      `Schema` for validation (`Schema.Struct`/`Schema.Literals`), mirroring
      `recipe-serializer.ts`'s established pattern exactly.
      `environment-store.ts` mirrors `RecipeStore`'s CRUD shape (list/get/
      save/delete), simpler since there's no legacy schema to migrate. Wired
      into `AppContext.stores.environmentStore` alongside `recipeStore`,
      sharing the same `dbPath`. Also deleted `EnvironmentImageSpec`/
      `EnvironmentAccelerator` from `types.ts` — leftover from iter 5, never
      actually used once `image-registry.ts` settled on a more flexible
      `variant: string` design; found via this iteration's knip run.
      New test file `environments-store.test.ts` (4 tests: parse
      defaults/validation, store round-trip, upsert-bumps-updatedAt).
      112/112 integration (up from 108) + 4/4 unit + lint/typecheck/jscpd/
      depcheck all green.
- [x] **Controller routes** (2026-07-01): new `environments/routes.ts`
      (`registerEnvironmentRoutes`, wired into `http/app.ts` next to
      `registerModelsRoutes`) — `GET /environments` (list), `GET
      /environments/:id` (get), `POST /environments` (create — validates
      `recipeId` references a real recipe before saving, mirrors
      `engines/routes.ts`'s recipe-route error-handling shape), `DELETE
      /environments/:id`. Every response includes the *resolved* `image`
      field (computed via `resolveEnvironmentImage` on read, never stored —
      per the no-second-source-of-truth decision from the persistence step).
      New route-level test `environments-routes.test.ts` (4 tests: reject
      create for a nonexistent recipe, create + resolve image, list/get/404,
      delete + re-delete 404) using the existing shared test harness
      (`fixtures.ts`'s `createTestApp`/`registerControllerTestLifecycle`).
      116/116 integration (up from 112) + 4/4 unit + lint/typecheck/jscpd/
      depcheck green. `container-command.ts` is the only remaining "unused
      file" per knip — expected, start/stop lifecycle (next) is what calls it.
      Also fixed a small pre-existing Effect-v4 gap found along the way: the
      shared `fixtures.ts` test harness had a raw `new Promise(resolve =>
      setTimeout(...))` in its `afterEach` — replaced with `delay()` from
      `core/async.ts`. Confirmed safe (116/116 still pass) since it's the
      exact same underlying `Effect.sleep`, just via the established
      Effect-backed helper instead of a bare Promise.
- [x] **Start/stop lifecycle** (2026-07-01): `environment-process.ts`
      (`startEnvironment`, `stopEnvironment`, `isEnvironmentRunning`) +
      `POST /environments/:id/start|stop` routes. Fixed a naming bug first:
      `buildDockerRunArguments`/`buildEnvironmentContainerCommand` derived the
      container name from `recipe.id`, but one recipe can back *multiple*
      environments (different engine/version) — added a `containerName`
      override (`environmentContainerName(environmentId)` = `local-studio-
      env-{id}`), defaulting to the old recipe-based name for
      `wrapVllmInDocker`'s existing callers so nothing regressed there.
      `startEnvironment` mirrors `process-manager.ts`'s launch-then-verify
      pattern (spawn detached, `Effect.gen` + `delayEffect` for a brief
      settle window, check for an immediate crash) rather than the full
      `launchModel` machinery (log-tail capture, crash-loop budget) — kept
      deliberately minimal for a first pass. `stopEnvironment` reuses the
      same stop→poll→force-kill shape as `process-manager.ts`'s
      `killProcess`, simplified because Docker's own `--rm` flag handles
      container removal once it exits (no PID-tree walking needed).
      `isEnvironmentRunning` is a plain `docker ps --filter` check — no
      in-memory tracking, so it's correct even across controller restarts.
      List/get responses now include `running` alongside `image`.
      **Testing note**: Docker is actually installed on this dev machine, so
      tests deliberately never exercise a real successful `start` — that
      would spawn a genuine `docker run` against a multi-gigabyte official
      image with no model/GPU present, hanging or polluting the host. Tests
      cover the safe paths only (unknown-id 404s, not-running short-circuit,
      `isEnvironmentRunning` for a nonexistent container) — a real start/stop
      round-trip still needs manual verification on a host with Docker + GPU
      + a downloaded model. 122/122 integration (up from 116) + 4/4 unit +
      lint/typecheck/jscpd/depcheck green. Whole `environments/` module is
      now 399 lines across 7 files, none over 90 lines.
- [x] **Frontend** (2026-07-01): `/environments` page (`app/environments/
      page.tsx`, 192 lines) + `features/environments/use-environments.ts`
      (153 lines, the data/actions hook) + `lib/api/environments.ts` (28
      lines, `createEnvironmentsApi` following the exact `createRecipesApi`
      shape). Deliberately used the simpler "container calls a hook, renders
      inline" pattern from `usage-page.tsx` rather than the heavier
      3-file atom/component/container split `recipes-content/` uses — that
      split earns its complexity from ~30 files of tabs/modal/explore-tab
      logic; a v1 list+create-form page doesn't need the same ceremony
      (matches "don't design for hypothetical future requirements"). Reuses
      existing `@/ui` primitives entirely (`AppPage`, `PageState`, `Table`,
      `Select`, `Input`, `Button`, `RefreshButton`) — no new form controls
      invented. Added a `/environments` nav entry in `left-sidebar.tsx`
      (`Boxes` icon). Data-fetching follows the established
      `useSyncExternalStore`-based "load once on mount" pattern (no
      `useEffect`, matching the codebase's ban). Frontend
      lint/typecheck/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build all
      green; `/environments` shows in the build's static route list.
      **Part A (the user's headline `/environments` ask) is now
      end-to-end complete**: types → persistence → image resolution →
      container command building → CRUD + start/stop routes → frontend page.
- [x] **Reuse existing recipe types**: confirmed — `buildEnvironmentContainerCommand`
      takes the existing `Recipe` type directly, no second recipe concept forked.

## Part B — engine system simplification

**2026-07-01 (iter 2) research complete** — full duplication map + ordered
refactor steps below, produced by deep-reading every file in
`controller/src/modules/engines/`. Key finding: **`engine-spec.ts` already IS**
a rich `EngineSpec`-shaped interface (`id, healthPath, cliBinary, buildCommand,
managedPackageSpec, install, detectInvocation, extract*, probeBinary?,
resolvePythonPath?, getRuntimeInfo?, getConfigHelp?`), and
`specs/{vllm,sglang,llamacpp,mlx}-spec.ts` already implement it. **This is not
a from-scratch redesign** — it's (1) deleting dead/duplicate parallel
implementations that bypass the spec, and (2) making every consumer
(`routes.ts` above all) go through `getEngineSpec(backend).X` instead of ad-hoc
direct imports into `runtime-info.ts`/`vllm-runtime.ts`/`llamacpp-runtime.ts`.

Ordered steps (each = one verifiable commit; run `npm run test:integration`
+ the two named contract tests after each):

- [x] **Step 1** (2026-07-01): `vllm-runtime.ts` had its own private near-copy
      of `runEnvironmentUpgradeCommand` (different default timeout) instead of
      importing the shared one from `upgrade-config.ts`. Deleted the copy.
- [x] **Step 2** (2026-07-01): `runtime-info.ts`'s `getMlxRuntimeInfo` (sync,
      `runCommand`) duplicated `specs/mlx-spec.ts`'s `getRuntimeInfoAsync`
      (async, `runCommandAsync`) — same candidate-python discovery + a
      copy-pasted `MLX_IMPORT_PROBE` string. `routes.ts`'s `GET /runtime/mlx`
      called the sync dead-path directly instead of
      `getEngineSpec("mlx").getRuntimeInfo`. Repointed the route, deleted the
      duplicate implementation + its private helpers.
- [x] **Step 3** (2026-07-01): same pattern for llama.cpp — `runtime-info.ts`'s
      `getLlamacppConfigHelp` duplicated `specs/llamacpp-spec.ts`'s
      `getConfigHelp` (same "resolve bin → runCommandAsync --help" logic).
      Repointed `/runtime/llamacpp/config` to `getEngineSpec("llamacpp")`,
      deleted the duplicate.
- [ ] **Step 4**: Unify `routes.ts`'s four different backend-info access
      patterns (vllm/mlx go direct to runtime files, sglang/llamacpp go
      through `runtime-targets.ts`, only sglang's `/config` route uses
      `getEngineSpec`) onto one consistent `getEngineSpec(backend).X` pattern.
      Keep `runtime-targets.ts` only for the multi-source discovery UI
      (`/runtime/targets*`), not per-backend single-info routes. NOT DONE YET
      — bigger/riskier than steps 1-3, touches `routes.ts` (474 lines) broadly.
- [x] **Step 5** (2026-07-01): Converted the two leaf files that actually had
      async work. `install-lock.ts`'s `acquireEngineInstallLock` (a polling
      loop: try-acquire, `await delay(pollMs)`, repeat until timeout) is now
      `Effect.gen`-based using the existing `delayEffect`, with the original
      Promise-returning signature kept as a thin `Effect.runPromise` wrapper
      (same convention as `core/command.ts`'s `runCommandAsync`) — zero
      call-site changes needed. `managed-venv.ts`'s `installIntoManagedVenv`
      (venv creation → installer resolution → pip/uv install with streaming
      progress callbacks → post-install probe) fully converted to
      `Effect.gen` composing `runCommandAsyncEffect` directly instead of
      awaiting the Promise wrapper; the one remaining Promise call
      (`probePythonRuntime`, in a different file, out of scope today) is
      lifted via `Effect.promise` since it never rejects (internally uses
      `runCommandAsync`, which never rejects). **`launch-failure-budget.ts`
      needed NO conversion** — checked and it's pure synchronous in-memory
      state (a `Map`-based crash-loop counter), zero async/Promise anywhere;
      wrapping it in Effect would be pure ceremony, so left as-is. Controller
      lint/typecheck/99 integration tests/4 unit tests/jscpd/depcheck all
      green after.
- [x] **Step 6** (2026-07-01): `process-utilities.ts` needed **no conversion**
      — checked, it's 100% synchronous (`spawnSync`/`process.kill`/plain
      object building), zero `async`/`Promise`/`await` anywhere. In
      `process-manager.ts`, converted the 3 functions with genuine async work
      to `Effect.gen` (same "Effect-native + thin Promise wrapper" pattern as
      steps 5): `killProcess` (signal + two poll-for-death loops + final
      settle delay), `cleanupOrphanedInferenceWorkers` (signal + poll-for-death
      loop), and `evictModel` (pure sequential composition of the two above +
      `findInferenceProcess`). **Deliberately left `launchModel` and
      `findInferenceProcess` as plain async/Promise** — `findInferenceProcess`
      has no actual async operation in its body (nothing to model in Effect);
      `launchModel` mixes a timed wait with long-lived `child.on(...)`/
      `readline` event-listener registration that outlives the wait itself
      (stdout/stderr line capture keeps running after the "did it crash in the
      first 3s" check returns) — forcing that into `Effect.callback` would be
      real behavioral-modeling work, not a mechanical port, and this is the
      actual model-launch path (same risk profile the plan calls out for
      `engine-coordinator.ts` in step 7). Verified `npm run test:integration`
      (all 99, including `runtime-recipe-contracts.test.ts`'s crash-loop/kill
      scenarios) + lint/typecheck/jscpd/depcheck all green before treating
      this done.
- [ ] **Step 7**: Convert `engine-coordinator.ts` LAST — largest state machine,
      most callers, highest risk (abort/lock/lifecycle-intent logic is only
      integration-tested end-to-end, not unit-tested). Diff carefully against
      `runtime-recipe-contracts.test.ts` (1055 lines) + `stream-proxy-contracts
      .test.ts` (507 lines) before/after.

Confirmed: `grep -rn 'from "effect"' controller/src/modules/engines/**` returns
**zero hits** as of 2026-07-01 — the whole module is 100% raw async/Promise
today (routes.ts alone has 81 async/await/Promise occurrences). Steps 5-7
above are the actual Effect-v4 migration for this module.

Files already clean, no action needed: `launch-state.ts`,
`launch-failure-budget.ts`, `model-runtime-defaults.ts`, `install-lock.ts`,
`argument-utilities.ts` (each single-purpose, <100 lines — already exo-cli
sized). `backend-builder.ts` vs `specs/*` and `runtime-target-factory.ts` vs
`specs/*` are NOT duplicated — already correctly split (verified, not just
assumed).

## Part C — repo-wide sweep checklist

Tracked as a living checklist; check off per-file/per-package as done. Re-run
the audit commands below at the start of each iteration to see current counts.

- [x] **Dependency pinning** (no `^`/`~` in any package.json): fixed
      2026-07-01 — `effect` in cli/controller/frontend, `yaml` in frontend.
- [ ] **File size** (no source file > 500 lines, tests exempt): as of 2026-07-01,
      non-test offenders (run
      `find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" ... | xargs wc -l | sort -rn`
      to refresh):
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/agent-workspace-shell.tsx` (was 629,
        regressed by the quick-composer-panel feature added same day — fixed
        2026-07-01: now 306 lines, extracted `quick-panel/quick-panel-top-bar.tsx`
        (53 lines), `agent-workspace-navigation.ts` (116 lines),
        `render-workspace-pane.tsx` (175 lines). Each new file is a cohesive,
        independently-testable unit — matches the exo-cli small-file ethos.)
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/timeline/session-pane-block-router.tsx`
        (was 772, fixed 2026-07-01: now 134 lines, extracted `activity-grouping.ts`
        (208, pure logic — types + `groupAssistantBlocks`/`buildActivityItems`/
        `summarizeActivity`/etc., no JSX), `turn-status-divider.tsx` (67),
        `assistant-activity-group.tsx` (181), `user-message-block.tsx` (127),
        `assistant-message-actions.tsx` (61). Updated
        `tests/frontend/e2e/agent-session-runtime-regressions.test.ts`'s import
        of `groupAssistantBlocks` to the new `activity-grouping` module (no
        back-compat re-export kept). 69/70 e2e tests pass — the 1 failure
        (`skill mentions...composer prompt construction`) is pre-existing,
        verified via `git stash` against the unmodified file, unrelated
        subsystem — see "Discovered issues" below.)
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/chat-pane-hooks.tsx` (was 736, fixed
        2026-07-01: deleted the barrel file entirely — it had exactly one
        consumer (`chat-pane.tsx`) — and split its 8 hooks into 6 cohesive
        files: `chat-pane-snapshot.ts` (4, the shared no-op
        `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot getter every other file imports, so
        it isn't duplicated 4x), `chat-pane-derived-state.ts` (35),
        `chat-pane-ui-effects.ts` (140, the 3 small UI-sync hooks:
        stick-to-bottom, mention rows, context-attach), `chat-pane-
        runtime-handle.ts` (58), `chat-pane-session-title.ts` (90), and
        `chat-pane-send-flow.ts` (417, the big one — kept as one file since
        it's a single cohesive send/queue/steer/retry flow and 417 lines is
        still comfortably under 500, not worth fragmenting further). Verified
        via `git stash`/`git stash pop` that the 4 e2e test failures beyond
        the already-known "skill mentions" one are also pre-existing on the
        unmodified tree (215 tests, 210 pass, 5 fail — identical before and
        after) — see "Discovered issues" below, not caused by this split.
        Frontend lint/typecheck/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/
        build all green.
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/browser-host/browser-host.ts` (was 715,
        fixed 2026-07-01: now 441 lines. Split out `hosted-page.ts` (283
        lines) — the `HostedPage` class, a fully self-contained wrapper
        around one CDP page connection (console ring, ref map, screencast
        fanout), along with the types only it uses (`ConsoleEntry`,
        `PageState`, `ScreencastFrame`, subscriber types, `CdpTarget`) and
        its one private helper (`remoteObjectText`). `browser-host.ts` keeps
        the `BrowserHost` manager class, the target-discovery helpers
        (`fetchTargets`, `createBlankPage`), and the input-event helpers
        (`mouseEvent`, `keyEvent`, `clampDelta`), importing `HostedPage` and
        re-exporting the page-level types so the module's public surface
        (`browserHost`, `MouseInput`, `KeyInput` — confirmed via grep to be
        the only things any of the 5 API-route consumers actually import) is
        unchanged. Also fixed a raw `new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(...))`
        found in `fetchTargets`'s retry-poll loop while restructuring —
        replaced with the existing `delay()` Effect helper from `lib/
        async.ts`. No dedicated tests exist for this module (a pre-existing
        gap, not introduced here); verified via typecheck/lint/cycles/
        ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build, all green — this was a
        careful line-for-line relocation with the one intentional async fix,
        not a rewrite.
  - [ ] `frontend/src/features/agent/runtime/session-runtime-controller.ts` (709)
        — deferred (iter 12): it's one ~550-line closure
        (`createSessionRuntimeController`), not independently-separable
        top-level units like the successful splits above, and project memory
        flags this exact file as having had its "ordering consolidated" in a
        prior session (2026-06-09) with smoke-testing still pending — a
        careless split risks reintroducing a subtle bug. Revisit only with a
        dedicated pass, not as a routine file-size item.
  - [x] `frontend/src/hooks/realtime-status-store.ts` (678 → 482) — split
        into `realtime-status-types.ts` (102: public types + pure view
        derivations `isActiveLaunchStage`/`sidebarStatusFromSnapshot`/
        `computeModelName`) and `realtime-status-equality.ts` (120: the 8
        pure snapshot-diffing functions, `areStatusEqual` through
        `areLeasesEqual`). The header comment referenced a
        `realtime-status-store/derive.ts` file that never actually existed
        (confirmed via `find`) — stale/aspirational, corrected by this split.
        Left the singleton-store core (module-scope mutable state, event
        handlers, polling, `start()`, `useRealtimeStatusStore()`) untouched
        in the main file, same risk-based reasoning as the
        `session-runtime-controller.ts` deferral above. Updated the 3 direct
        consumers (`use-sidebar-status.ts`, `dashboard-types.ts`,
        `server-view.tsx`) plus one e2e test (`status-sync.test.ts`) to
        import from the new files directly — no re-export shim, since there
        were only 3 easy call sites. Verified: typecheck/lint (0 errors, only
        the 1 pre-existing unrelated warning)/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/
        dupes/depcheck/build all green; full e2e suite shows exactly the
        same 4 pre-existing failures already documented from iterations 2
        and 10 (identical test names), nothing new broken.
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/agent-browser.tsx` (676 → 334) —
        split into 3 files by natural independent unit (all props-only, no
        shared module state, same low-risk profile as the earlier
        `browser-host.ts`/`chat-pane-hooks.tsx` splits):
        `agent-browser-start-page.tsx` (135: `LocalhostStartPage` +
        `LocalhostSiteRow`), `agent-browser-reading-view.tsx` (76:
        `ReadingView` + `resolveBrowserHref` + the `ReadablePage` type),
        `agent-browser-effects.ts` (137: the two `useSyncExternalStore`-based
        effect hooks `useLocalhostSitesEffects`/`useAgentBrowserEffects` +
        the `LocalhostSite` type they own). Main file keeps only the
        `AgentBrowser` component plus its 3 externally-consumed exports
        (`WebviewElement`, `AgentBrowserHandle`, confirmed via grep that
        `LocalhostSite` has no external consumers so it moved freely).
        Verified: typecheck/lint (0 errors, same 1 pre-existing unrelated
        warning)/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build all
        green; no tests reference this file directly; full e2e suite shows
        the same 4 pre-existing failures as iterations 2/10/12, nothing new
        broken.
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/filesystem-panel.tsx` (642 → 401) —
        extracted the one genuinely independent unit:
        `filesystem-panel-effects.ts` (242) holds
        `useFilesystemPanelEffects` (6 `useSyncExternalStore`-based
        subscriptions: cwd-ref sync, project reset, directory-entries fetch,
        remembered-file restore, external file-open-request handling,
        open-file content+comments fetch) plus its params type and the pure
        `relativePathForRequest` helper it alone uses. Confirmed via grep
        that neither the hook nor the helper has any consumer outside this
        component. Main file keeps the `FilesystemPanel` component itself
        (state + local callbacks + JSX) as one cohesive unit — it wasn't
        split further since all its pieces genuinely share the same local
        state, unlike the effects hook which only needed setters passed in.
        Verified: typecheck/lint (0 errors, same 1 pre-existing unrelated

        the same 4 pre-existing failures as iterations 2/10/12/13, nothing
        new broken.
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/use-workspace.ts` (623 → 445) —
        extracted the 3 self-contained hooks that only take `dispatch`/
        `sessions`/refs as params and own no state shared with the main
        `useWorkspace` hook: `use-workspace-effects.ts` (186) holds
        `useBrowserEventsEffects`, `useWorkspaceHydrationEffects` (+ its
        private `currentSearchParams`/`shouldRestoreWorkspace` helpers and
        the exported `hasExplicitSessionNavigation`), and
        `useWorkspaceRuntimeSync` (+ its private `runtimeSubscriptionKey`/
        `runtimeRegistryKey` helpers). `useWorkspace` itself — the reducer
        wiring, the browser-command controller, and the `handles` object —
        stayed as one unit since those pieces are genuinely coupled through
        shared refs (`stateRef`, `browserRef`, `toolsRef`). Updated the one
        test (`agent-session-runtime-regressions.test.ts`) that imported
        `hasExplicitSessionNavigation` to point at the new file. Verified:
        typecheck/lint (0 errors, same 1 pre-existing unrelated warning)/
        cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build all green; full
        e2e suite shows the same 4 pre-existing failures as iterations
        2/10/12/13/14, nothing new broken.
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/tools/context.tsx` (603 → 464) — split
        by concern rather than by mechanism: `canvas-effects.ts` (77:
        `useCanvasEffects` + `syncCanvasEffect` + the private
        `loadCanvasEffect`/`canvasSessionQuery` helpers) and
        `catalogue-effects.ts` (64: `useToolsCatalogueEffects` + the
        private `loadToolsCatalogueEffect`/`loadCatalogueListEffect`
        helpers) — cleaner than one grab-bag "effects" file since the two
        have nothing to do with each other. Also deleted a genuinely dead
        function while in there: `loadToolsCatalogue` (a plain-Promise
        wrapper around `loadToolsCatalogueEffect`) had zero callers anywhere
        in the repo — confirmed via a repo-wide grep before removing it, not
        just a knip guess. `ToolsProvider` itself stayed as one unit (its
        ~20 callbacks all close over the same `browser`/`computer`/
        `selectionsRef` state). Verified: typecheck/lint (0 errors, same 1
        pre-existing unrelated warning)/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/

        full e2e suite shows the same 4 pre-existing failures as iterations
        2/10/12/13/14/15, nothing new broken.
  - [x] `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/chat-pane-composer.ts` (595 → 306)
        — extracted the two hooks with no overlap in concern:
        `chat-pane-composer-attachments.ts` (129: `useComposerAttachments`
        — drag/drop/paste file attachment state) and
        `chat-pane-composer-mention-selection.ts` (160:
        `useComposerMentionSelection` + its private file/context-row-loading
        helpers). Deleted 3 confirmed-dead plain-Promise wrapper functions
        found while reading the file fully (`loadProjectFileAttachment`,
        `loadContextRow`, `jsonOrNull` — each had a `*Effect` sibling that
        was the one actually called; the plain wrapper had zero callers
        anywhere in the repo, same pattern as iteration 16's
        `loadToolsCatalogue`). Updated the one consumer (`chat-pane.tsx`)
        to import the two relocated hooks from their new files instead of
        the barrel. Verified: typecheck/lint (0 errors, same 1 pre-existing

  - [ ] `frontend/src/features/agent/pi-runtime.ts` (501)
- [ ] **Effect-v4 coverage**: `effect` package already pinned in all 3 workspaces.
      Need to audit raw `async`/`Promise`/`fetch` usage outside of Next.js route
      handlers (which must stay Promise-based per Next's contract) and convert
      internal business logic to `Effect.gen`/`Effect.tryPromise`. Not started —
      needs its own inventory pass (grep `async function\|: Promise<` per
      package, cross-reference against existing Effect usage).
- [ ] **Duplication**: `frontend` `jscpd` (`npm run check:dupes`) reports 0
      clones as of 2026-07-01 — keep re-running after each refactor batch.
      `controller` has no jscpd config yet — add one and baseline it.
- [ ] **React atom/component/container conventions**: not audited yet. Needs a
      pass identifying components mixing data-fetching + presentation that
      should split into container (data) + presentational (view) pairs, and any
      copy-pasted small UI bits (buttons, badges, pickers) that should become
      shared atoms.
- [ ] **Comments**: sweep for narrative/obvious comments (`// increment i`,
      restating the code) vs. legitimate why-comments; delete the former.
- [x] **Unused dependencies**: all three workspaces already have depcheck
      (`frontend`: `npm run depcheck`; `controller`/`cli`: bundled into their
      `check` script alongside knip+jscpd) — all clean as of 2026-07-01.

## Discovered issues (fixed 2026-07-01)

- Controller's own `lint`/`check` gates were already red before this initiative
  touched anything: `unicorn/prevent-abbreviations` on 4 `dataDir` params
  (renamed to `dataDirectory` in `process-utilities.ts` / `vllm-python-path.ts`),
  3 missing explicit return types in `openai-routes.ts`'s SSE keepalive stream,
  1 unused `toBytes` helper in `gpu.ts`. All fixed; `npm run lint` +
  `npm run typecheck` clean in `controller/`.
- `controller/src/modules/proxy/content-normalizer.test.ts` existed but wasn't
  wired into any script (knip flagged it as an "unused file") — added
  `test:unit` script (`bun test src`) and added `src/**/*.test.ts` to knip's
  `entry` config so future co-located tests are tracked. Test passes (4/4).
- **Real duplication found and removed**: `runtime-info.ts` had a full
  superseded sync `getSglangRuntimeInfo` (+ its private helpers
  `getRunningSglangPythonCandidates` + a copy-pasted `SGLANG_IMPORT_PROBE`
  string) that a comment in `sglang-spec.ts` explicitly says was replaced by an
  async version — the old code was just never deleted. Removed 62 lines;
  99/99 controller integration tests still pass.
- `optionalStringArray` in `core/validation.ts` was a genuinely dead validation
  helper (no route uses it) — removed.
- `redactLogContent` (`core/log-redaction.ts`) is a **knip false positive**:
  it's used from `tests/controller/integration/log-redaction.test.ts`, which
  lives outside `controller/` and isn't in knip's scan scope. Tried adding
  `../tests/controller/**/*.ts` to knip's `entry` — didn't resolve it (glob
  likely not honored outside the package root). Left as a known false positive
  rather than fight the tool further or risk deleting live code; revisit if a
  cleaner knip config approach is found.

## Discovered issues (not yet triaged)

- `tests/frontend/e2e/agent-session-runtime-regressions.test.ts`: "skill
  mentions and selected skill context survive composer prompt construction"
  fails on `main` independent of any change made in this initiative (confirmed
  via `git stash` — same failure on the unmodified tree). Expected
  `/Loaded skills:/` in composer-constructed prompt text, got `"open the
  page"`. Unrelated subsystem (composer/skill-mention prompt construction, not
  timeline/activity rendering) — needs its own investigation, not touched here.
- `frontend/scripts/patch-pi-ai-openai-text-boundaries.mjs` (a `postinstall`
  hook patching `@earendil-works/pi-ai`'s compiled output) throws
  `Could not find pi-ai assistant text join` when `npm install` re-runs
  lifecycle scripts — the text pattern it greps for no longer matches the
  installed dist file. Did not investigate further this iteration (unrelated to
  the dependency-pinning task that surfaced it); node_modules was unaffected.
  Needs its own look: either the patch's search pattern is stale vs. the
  currently pinned `@earendil-works/pi-ai` version, or the pinned version
  drifted without the patch being updated.
- 3 more pre-existing e2e failures found 2026-07-01 while verifying the
  `chat-pane-hooks.tsx` split (confirmed via `git stash` — same 3 fail on the
  unmodified tree, so unrelated to that split): `agent-browser-tools-
  regressions.test.ts` — "file tagging turns an @ mention into one durable
  project-file attachment" (`kind: 'file'` vs expected `kind: 'plugin'`) and
  "MCP plugin slash and at-mention context persist selected plugin state";
  `agent-workspace-regressions.test.ts` — "pane state round-trips durable
  session metadata and drops transcripts" (expects `{plugins, skills,
  promptTemplates}` on restored pane state, gets `undefined`). All three look
  like the same underlying plugin/skill-context persistence area as the
  already-known "skill mentions" failure — plausibly one root cause across
  all 4, not yet investigated.

## Iteration log

- **2026-07-01 (iter 1)**: researched exo-cli, wrote this plan, fixed dependency
  pinning (3 package.json files: `effect` in cli/controller/frontend, `yaml` in
  frontend — all lockfiles re-synced, all 3 workspaces still typecheck clean),
  fixed the `agent-workspace-shell.tsx` file-size regression from the same-day
  quick-composer-panel work (629 → 306 lines via 3 new extracted files, full
  frontend gate green after: lint/typecheck/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/
  depcheck). Found and fixed controller's pre-existing red lint gate (8 errors)
  plus real dead code (62-line duplicate sglang runtime-info implementation,
  1 dead validation helper) — see "Discovered issues" above; controller
  lint/typecheck/99-integration-tests/unit-test all green. Found the pi-ai
  postinstall patch issue (not yet fixed). Did not yet start Part A/B (new
  feature + engine rewrite) — those are large, higher-risk, multi-file changes
  that need a dedicated iteration with full attention, not a rushed pass.
  Next iteration: pick the next unchecked file-size item above, OR start
  Part B by reading `engine-coordinator.ts` + `runtime-targets.ts` +
  `process-manager.ts` together to map real duplication before touching code.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 2)**: split `session-pane-block-router.tsx` (772 → 134
  lines, 5 new files, see checklist above). Researched Part B in full via a
  dedicated read-only agent — `engine-spec.ts` already is a rich EngineSpec,
  no redesign needed, just consistency + dead-code removal; wrote the ordered
  7-step plan into Part B above. Executed steps 1-3 (all "near-zero risk" per
  the research): deleted a duplicate `runEnvironmentUpgradeCommand` in
  `vllm-runtime.ts`; found and fixed a **live** duplicate (not just dead code
  this time) — `runtime-info.ts`'s sync `getMlxRuntimeInfo` bypassed
  `getEngineSpec("mlx")` from the `/runtime/mlx` route while the aggregate
  `/system` route already used the spec version, so the two disagreed on
  `upgrade_command_available`; verified the frontend doesn't actually consume
  that field from the direct route before repointing it (no user-visible
  regression) and deleted the dead sync implementation + 3 orphaned helpers
  (`splitCommand`/`resolvePythonCandidate`/`looksLikePythonExecutable`, dead
  once their last caller was removed); did the same pattern for llama.cpp
  config-help (deleted `runtimes/llamacpp-runtime.ts` entirely, repointed
  `/runtime/llamacpp/config` to `getEngineSpec("llamacpp").getConfigHelp`,
  after upgrading the spec's version to match the runtime version's more
  robust binary-path resolution so behavior didn't regress). Controller
  lint/typecheck/99 integration tests/4 unit tests/jscpd/depcheck all green
  after each step. Part B steps 4-7 (routes.ts consistency pass, Effect-v4
  conversion) remain — step 4 touches routes.ts broadly and needs its own
  focused iteration; steps 5-7 are the real Effect migration.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 3)**: executed Part B step 5 (Effect-v4 conversion of the
  leaf runtime files) — see Part B above for detail. `install-lock.ts` and
  `managed-venv.ts` now compose `runCommandAsyncEffect`/`delayEffect` via
  `Effect.gen` internally, keeping their existing Promise-returning public
  signatures via thin `Effect.runPromise` wrappers (same house convention as
  `core/command.ts`). Confirmed `launch-failure-budget.ts` has no async work
  and needs no conversion. Controller lint/typecheck/99 integration/4 unit
  tests/jscpd/depcheck all green. Next iteration: step 6
  (`process-manager.ts` 440 lines / `process-utilities.ts` 202 lines →
  Effect) — bigger surface than step 5, read both fully before converting,
  same verify-after-each-file discipline. Step 4 (routes.ts consistency) and
  step 7 (engine-coordinator.ts, highest risk, do last) still untouched.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 4)**: executed Part B step 6 — see Part B above for the
  full breakdown and the risk judgment call (converted the 3 genuinely-async
  `process-manager.ts` functions, left `launchModel`'s event-driven spawn
  logic alone as too risky for a mechanical port). `process-utilities.ts`
  needed no changes (pure sync). Controller lint/typecheck/99 integration
  tests (including the crash-loop/kill contract tests, since this touches the
  actual kill/evict path)/4 unit tests/jscpd/depcheck all green. Remaining in
  Part B: step 4 (routes.ts consistency — 4 inconsistent backend-info access
  patterns, not yet unified) and step 7 (`engine-coordinator.ts`, 252 lines,
  the highest-risk one, saved for last on purpose — read it fully alongside
  `runtime-recipe-contracts.test.ts` and `stream-proxy-contracts.test.ts`
  before touching anything). Part A (`/environments` Docker feature) and the
  ~21 remaining file-size items in Part C are still fully untouched — worth
  picking one of those next if step 7 doesn't feel safe to rush.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 5)**: pivoted to Part A after 4 iterations of Part B/C
  cleanup — the user's headline ask (a new `/environments` page) hadn't been
  touched yet. Before writing any code, discovered the existing
  `docker_image`/`wrapVllmInDocker` mechanism is a narrow vLLM-only escape
  hatch for one custom-forked image, not a generalizable template — so
  researched the real official Docker images for vLLM/SGLang/llama.cpp via
  WebSearch/WebFetch instead of guessing container internals (see Part A
  above for sources and findings). Extracted a safe, verified
  `buildDockerRunArguments` helper from `wrapVllmInDocker` first, then built
  the `environments` module foundation (types + pure image-resolution +
  container-command builders) on top of the *real* image/entrypoint
  contracts, with 9 new passing tests. Deliberately excluded MLX (no GPU
  passthrough for Docker on macOS, no official image exists). Did NOT build
  persistence/routes/frontend yet — those need the same careful pace, and
  rushing a Docker orchestration lifecycle (build/start/stop, container
  reaping, log streaming) without room to verify each piece would risk
  exactly the kind of complexity the user is asking to get away from. Next
  iteration: environments store (mirror `recipe-store.ts`'s shape), then
  routes, then frontend page — in that order, one verified commit each.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 6)**: built the environments persistence layer — see
  Part A above. Corrected a wrong assumption from iter 5's plan (recipe
  storage is SQLite, not JSON-file) by actually reading `recipe-store.ts`
  before building anything, rather than trusting the earlier note. Also used
  this iteration's knip run to catch and delete two types (`EnvironmentImageSpec`,
  `EnvironmentAccelerator`) left over from iter 5 that never got wired up
  once the design settled on something more flexible — exactly the kind of
  self-cleanup this initiative should keep doing every iteration, not just
  on the original codebase. `container-command.ts`/`image-registry.ts` still
  show as "unused files" in knip — expected, routes aren't built yet. Next
  iteration: controller routes (`POST /environments` create, `GET
  /environments` list, `DELETE /environments/:id`) wiring the store +
  image-registry + container-command together, following `models/routes.ts`
  or `engines/routes.ts` for the Hono route-registration convention already
  used elsewhere. Start/stop lifecycle (actually running the docker command)
  can come after — get create/list/delete + the resolved image visible in
  the API first, verify with a route-level integration test before adding
  process lifecycle.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 7)**: built environments CRUD routes (`GET/POST
  /environments`, `GET/DELETE /environments/:id`) — see Part A above. Reused
  the exact recipe-route conventions from `engines/routes.ts` (validation via
  `badRequest`/`notFound`, `parseJsonObjectBody`) rather than inventing a new
  pattern, and put them in a dedicated `environments/routes.ts` file instead
  of appending to the already-oversized `engines/routes.ts` (474 lines,
  itself a flagged Part C file-size item) — no point making that cleanup
  harder later. Added a route-level test using the project's existing shared
  test harness (`fixtures.ts`). Also fixed a small pre-existing raw-Promise
  gap in that shared harness while in the area. 116/116 integration + 4/4
  unit + lint/typecheck/jscpd/depcheck all green. Next iteration: start/stop
  container lifecycle (`POST /environments/:id/start|stop`) — read
  `process-manager.ts`'s docker stop/kill handling again first and reuse it,
  don't re-invent container teardown. After that: the frontend `/environments`
  page itself, which is still fully untouched.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 8)**: built start/stop container lifecycle — see Part A
  above. Caught and fixed a real design bug before it shipped: container
  naming was keyed off `recipe.id`, which breaks the moment one recipe backs
  two environments (e.g. trying both vLLM v0.11.0 and v0.12.0 against the
  same model) — added an explicit `containerName` override. Kept the actual
  process lifecycle intentionally minimal (no log-tail capture, no
  crash-loop budget) rather than porting all of `launchModel`'s complexity,
  since this is a first pass and over-building it now would work against
  "cleanest possible." Also made a deliberate testing-safety call: this dev
  machine actually has Docker installed, so a naive integration test hitting
  `/start` for real would try to pull a multi-gigabyte vLLM/SGLang/llama.cpp
  image with no GPU or model present — tested only the side-effect-free
  paths instead and left a clear note that the real happy path needs manual
  verification. Whole environments module: 399 lines / 7 files, all under
  90 lines each. **Part A backend is now functionally complete** (types,
  persistence, image resolution, container command building, full CRUD +
  start/stop routes). Next iteration: the frontend `/environments` page —
  still the one completely untouched piece of the user's original ask. Look
  at `frontend/src/app/recipes/page.tsx` (or equivalent) and the existing
  `/api/agent/projects`-style Next.js API-route-proxying-to-controller
  pattern before designing it from scratch.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 9)**: built the `/environments` frontend page — the last
  untouched piece of the user's original ask, see Part A above. Studied
  `recipes-content/` (the existing model/view/container split) and
  `usage-page.tsx` (a simpler container+hook page) before choosing the
  latter's shape, since the recipe feature's 3-file split is justified by its
  real complexity (tabs, modal, explore/downloads sub-tabs across ~30 files)
  and forcing that same structure onto a v1 list+create-form page would be
  premature. Full stack: `lib/types.ts` (`Environment`/`EnvironmentWithStatus`
  /`EnvironmentPayload`, careful not to collide with the pre-existing,
  unrelated `EnvironmentInfo` type also in that file), `lib/api/
  environments.ts` (mirrors `createRecipesApi`'s exact shape), `use-
  environments.ts` (state + actions, `useSyncExternalStore` load-on-mount,
  no `useEffect`), `app/environments/page.tsx` (entirely built from existing
  `@/ui` primitives — no new form controls), plus a sidebar nav entry.
  Frontend gate green end to end including a real production build (`
  /environments` shows in the static route list). **This closes out Part A
  end-to-end**: a user can now create an environment (recipe + engine +
  pinned version + optional variant), see its resolved official image and
  running status, and start/stop it, all from one page backed by the
  controller work from iterations 5-8.

  Remaining work for future iterations: Part B step 4 (routes.ts
  backend-info-access consistency) and step 7 (engine-coordinator.ts Effect
  conversion, saved for last as highest-risk); Part C has ~21 file-size
  items still outstanding, the Effect-v4 coverage audit hasn't been done as
  a systematic pass (only fixed opportunistically wherever an iteration
  happened to touch async code), and the react atom/component/container
  audit + comment sweep haven't been started at all. The pi-ai postinstall
  patch script issue and the one knip false positive (`redactLogContent`)
  are still open. A manual end-to-end test of the real `/environments`
  start flow (on a host with Docker + GPU + a real downloaded model) is
  still owed — every iteration so far has only verified the side-effect-free
  paths automatically.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 10)**: with Part A complete, pivoted back to Part C.
  Split `chat-pane-hooks.tsx` (736 → deleted, 6 new files under 420 lines
  each) — see the checklist above for the breakdown. Extracted a shared
  `chat-pane-snapshot.ts` for the trivial no-op `useSyncExternalStore`
  snapshot getter every hook needs, rather than letting 4+ files each define
  their own copy. While verifying the split via `git stash`, discovered 3
  MORE pre-existing e2e failures beyond the one already known from iteration
  2 (all plugin/skill-persistence related, possibly one root cause) —
  documented in "Discovered issues" rather than silently ignored. Frontend
  gate green end to end (lint/typecheck/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/
  depcheck/build). Next iteration: continue down the file-size list
  (`browser-host.ts` 715, `session-runtime-controller.ts` 709, or
  `realtime-status-store.ts` 678 are next) — same read-fully-then-split
  discipline, and keep using `git stash` to separate "pre-existing failure"
  from "did I just break this" before assuming a refactor is safe.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 11)**: split `browser-host.ts` (715 → 441 lines) — see
  Part C checklist above. Confirmed via grep before touching anything that
  the module's only external consumers (5 API routes) import just
  `browserHost`/`MouseInput`/`KeyInput`, so extracting the fully
  self-contained `HostedPage` class into its own `hosted-page.ts` (283
  lines) needed no public-surface changes. Also fixed a raw-Promise
  `setTimeout` poll loop found in `fetchTargets` while in there — replaced
  with the existing `delay()` Effect helper. This module (server-side CDP
  browser automation) has no dedicated automated tests, a pre-existing gap;
  relied on careful line-for-line code review plus typecheck/lint/cycles/
  ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build all green as the verification
  bar, same as steps 5/6 in Part B when touching untested infrastructure.
  Next iteration: `session-runtime-controller.ts` (709 lines) is next on the
  list, but per project memory it was deliberately consolidated for careful
  ordering in a prior session (2026-06-09) — read it fully and check
  `docs/`/memory context for *why* before splitting, since this one may be
  more order-sensitive than a typical file-size target. `realtime-status-
  store.ts` (678) is a safer fallback if `session-runtime-controller.ts`
  looks too risky to touch without more context.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 12)**: read `session-runtime-controller.ts` fully first
  as instructed — confirmed it's one ~550-line closure
  (`createSessionRuntimeController`), not independently-separable top-level
  units like the successful splits so far, and combined with the project
  memory flag (ordering deliberately consolidated 2026-06-09, smoke-testing
  still pending) this makes it too risky for a routine file-size pass.
  Deferred it (documented above in the Part C checklist) and took the
  pre-identified fallback: split `realtime-status-store.ts` (678 → 482)
  into `realtime-status-types.ts` and `realtime-status-equality.ts` — see
  the Part C checklist entry above for the full breakdown. Also caught and
  corrected a stale comment: the file's header claimed views should derive
  from a `realtime-status-store/derive.ts` file that was confirmed (via
  `find`) to never actually exist — the split's new `realtime-status-
  types.ts` now fills that intended role for real, and the header comment
  was updated to point at it. Frontend gate green end to end (typecheck/
  lint/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build), e2e suite shows
  the same 4 pre-existing failures as documented in iterations 2 and 10,
  nothing new broken. Next iteration: continue down the Part C file-size
  list — `agent-browser.tsx` (676) or `filesystem-panel.tsx` (642) are next;
  `session-runtime-controller.ts` stays deferred until a dedicated pass.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 13)**: split `agent-browser.tsx` (676 → 334) — see the
  Part C checklist above for the file breakdown. This one was a clean, low-
  risk split: the localhost-start-page view, the reading-mode view, and the
  two effect hooks were all props-only with zero shared module-scope state,
  same shape as the successful `browser-host.ts`/`chat-pane-hooks.tsx`
  splits. Confirmed via grep first that `LocalhostSite` (the one type that
  moved) has no external consumers, so no compatibility shim was needed.
  Frontend gate green end to end (typecheck/lint/cycles/ui-structure/
  deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build), e2e suite shows the same 4 pre-existing
  failures as iterations 2/10/12, nothing new broken. Next iteration:
  `filesystem-panel.tsx` (642) is next on the Part C list;
  `session-runtime-controller.ts` stays deferred until a dedicated pass.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 14)**: split `filesystem-panel.tsx` (642 → 401) — see
  the Part C checklist above for the breakdown. Only one piece of this file
  was independently separable (the `useFilesystemPanelEffects` hook + its
  private `relativePathForRequest` helper, which take setters as params and
  own no module-scope state of their own); the `FilesystemPanel` component
  itself stayed as one unit since its callbacks and JSX all share the same
  local state and splitting further would just be moving code around for
  its own sake. Confirmed via grep that both extracted pieces have zero
  consumers outside this file. Frontend gate green end to end (typecheck/
  lint/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build), e2e suite shows
  the same 4 pre-existing failures as iterations 2/10/12/13, nothing new
  broken. Next iteration: `use-workspace.ts` (623) is next on the Part C
  list; `session-runtime-controller.ts` stays deferred until a dedicated
  pass.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 15)**: split `use-workspace.ts` (623 → 445) — see the
  Part C checklist above for the breakdown. Extracted the 3 hooks that only
  depend on params (dispatch/sessions/refs), not on `useWorkspace`'s own
  local state, into `use-workspace-effects.ts` (186). Had to fix one test
  import (`agent-session-runtime-regressions.test.ts` imported the
  relocated `hasExplicitSessionNavigation`) — caught immediately by running
  the full e2e suite before considering the iteration done, exactly the
  discipline this loop keeps relying on. Frontend gate green end to end
  (typecheck/lint/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build), e2e
  suite shows the same 4 pre-existing failures as iterations
  2/10/12/13/14, nothing new broken. Next iteration:
  `frontend/src/features/agent/tools/context.tsx` (603) is next on the
  Part C list; `session-runtime-controller.ts` stays deferred until a
  dedicated pass.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 16)**: split `tools/context.tsx` (603 → 464) — see the
  Part C checklist above for the breakdown. Split by concern
  (canvas vs. tools-catalogue) rather than lumping every extracted hook
  into one generic "effects" file, since the two have nothing to do with
  each other and a grab-bag file would just be a new place for unrelated
  code to accumulate. Also deleted a confirmed-dead function
  (`loadToolsCatalogue`, a never-called plain-Promise wrapper) found while
  reading the file fully before splitting — exactly the kind of
  opportunistic cleanup this loop should keep doing. Frontend gate green
  end to end (typecheck/lint/cycles/ui-structure/deadcode/dupes/depcheck/
  build), e2e suite shows the same 4 pre-existing failures as iterations
  2/10/12/13/14/15, nothing new broken. Next iteration:
  `frontend/src/features/agent/ui/chat-pane-composer.ts` (595) is next on
  the Part C list; `session-runtime-controller.ts` stays deferred until a
  dedicated pass.

- **2026-07-01 (iter 17)**: split `chat-pane-composer.ts` (595 → 306) — see
  the Part C checklist above for the breakdown. Split by hook rather than
  by mechanism, same as the previous two iterations. Found and deleted 3
  MORE dead plain-Promise wrapper functions (`loadProjectFileAttachment`,
  `loadContextRow`, `jsonOrNull`) sitting alongside their actually-used
  `*Effect` counterparts — this is now the second iteration in a row where
  reading a file fully before splitting turned up dead Effect-adjacent
  wrapper functions, suggesting this "keep the old Promise wrapper after
  converting to Effect" pattern is worth a dedicated grep sweep across the
  whole frontend at some point rather than only catching it opportunistically.
  Frontend gate green end to end (typecheck/lint/cycles/ui-structure/
  deadcode/dupes/depcheck/build), e2e suite shows the same 4 pre-existing
  failures as iterations 2/10/12/13/14/15/16, nothing new broken. Next
  iteration: `controller/src/modules/system/metrics-collector.ts` (565) is
  next on the Part C list — the first CONTROLLER file-size target in this
  loop (all of iterations 10-17 have been frontend); read
  `controller/src/modules/engines/routes.ts` or another already-modularized
  controller file for the house route/module conventions before touching
  it. `session-runtime-controller.ts` stays deferred until a dedicated
  pass.
