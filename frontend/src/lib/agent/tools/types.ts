// Tool surface types — split into two pieces:
//
// 1. UI state (workspace-global): which side panel is open, panel width,
//    browser tool toggle, browser URL.
// 2. Per-session selection: which plugins/skills the composer has armed for
//    a given session. Lives in a flat map keyed by SessionId so panes /
//    sessions stay independent of tool choice.
